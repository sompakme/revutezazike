The rapper seems to be aware that some folks are a little confused about the exact number of&nbsp;children he's fathered, so he decided to address the subject during an Instagram live session with Rich the Kid.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“Aye look, I got four little boys, right?"&nbsp;the 20-year-old&nbsp;says in a clip from the live. "Matter fact, one of their birthdays is today. I got four little boys and I got one daughter, her name is Armani. I got&nbsp;another daughter on the way though. I got one daughter that's born. Y’all gotta stop that weird shit.”&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Last month,&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">two different women each gave birth</a> to a child that they share with NBA YoungBoy on the exact same day. A few days later, the rapper released a new song titled&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Death Enclaimed"</a> along with some accompanying visuals. On "Death Enclaimed," YoungBoy spits, "Tired of f*cking 'round with groupies/4 lil' boys and 2 lil' girls and they mine." However, according to his recent statement, one of his daughters has yet to be born.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the music video for "Death Enclaimed," YoungBoy is shown taking two of his sons to the beach.
