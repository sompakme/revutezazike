While you never know how one's partner will react to people checking out their significant other, Ice-T couldn't help but find it hilarious, per <a href=#>Page Six</a>. The rapper was so unfazed that he actually shared a video of the situation on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p>In the video, you can see Ice-T and Austin dancing to a music performance. As the two stars enjoy the show, another man appears to look at Ice-T and before checking out Coco. At the time, the "Law and Order: Special Victims Unit" star didn't seem to notice the man looking at his wife, but now the whole world knows with his post. Ice-T captioned the video, "Lol... I love how the white dude looked at me then took time to check Coco out.... I TOTALLY understand.. #2023Grammys" Clearly, the rapper is used to his wife getting attention and doesn't blame people for taking time to admire her.</p><p>Just like Ice-T, many of his followers found the video hilarious. Rapper Busta Rhymes <a href=#>commented</a> on the post with a bunch of laughing emojis. Another user <a href=#>remarked</a> on Ice-T's "confidence" for playing it cool. Meanwhile, others preemptively <a href=#>apologized</a>&nbsp;for staring at Coco in case they happen to cross paths someday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlpZoNyfI6imp5lpGKxqrDNrWSsr5WWwW60yKxksKGWmnqku8KoZJudmaO0brvToZyrq12axqZ5wpqlnbFdlsFuwMeeZGtoYmh6qL7ApqSyq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
