This was initially the case during the first attempt at re-caliberating the FX market, however those efforts lost steam due to inflation concerns.“There is hope the recent efforts to restore a flexible FX regime may be sustained given the willingness to accompany it with tighter monetary conditions. "The interbank FX rate has<a href=# rel=noopener> risen in recent days </a>to over N900, from N750, thereby significantly closing the gap to the parallel rate which is now just above N1,000."<h2>Naira problems</h2><p class=align-left>JP Morgan also said that the major challenge in CBN's plan to unify the exchange rate is limited FX liquidity in the official market and that the naira isn't a fully convertible <a href=#>currency</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/95a686ba9bf5ab99.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>“We have our views”: Tinubu’s govt sets ‘fair’ naira to dollar exchange rate target by December 2023</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The financial institution also noted that the backlog of forex is a major challenge.</p><p class=align-left>JPMorgan noted further:</p>"More Nigerians will patronise the parallel market due to lack of liquidity. In our opinion, when authorities refer to the FX backlog, they are referring to US $6.8 billion in FX forward commitments that the central bank has not honoured – the majority of which has been covered by commercial banks.“However, we estimate up to a further $$3-4billion (probably less given the FX adjustment) in unmet FX demand needed for goods and services imports. CBN will need to clear both backlogs, a difficult task given the low levels of <a id="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Functions/export.asp?tablename=reserve" href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net FX reserves.</a>“We previously estimated that Nigeria’s <a id="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Functions/export.asp?tablename=reserve" href=#>net FX reserves</a> could be as low as $3.7billion at the end of 2022. We do not have new information about the central banks short-term contingent liabilities, however gross FX reserves have further declined by $4.1billion through this year and now amount to around $33.3billion, suggesting the net position could be lower."<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7fa8c6b8a281ff65.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>“I only need 6 months”: Pastor Olumide says he can stop naira depreciation, gives 2 simple solutions</span></p></a><h2>Tinubu's govt sets 'fair' naira to dollar exchange rate target by December 2023</h2><p class=align-left>In a<a href=# rel=noopener> previous report by Legit.ng,</a> <a href=#>Tinubu</a> set an exchange rate target for naira before the end of 2023.</p><p class=align-left>Several reforms have been introduced, and it is expected that the dollar supply will ease the pressure.</p><p class=align-left>Naira continues to exchange at the lowest level in history at both the official and unofficial markets.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkr7a%2FyKecrKtdmrCwus6msGiln6OyunuQbm1qbWFtequ8jKamq5%2BRo3qltdKanqudlah6p7OMp25uaF2ZvK24wKtknrCTna6vs8RmqZqslWKvunnDnpqepZKav3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
