This was about two weeks before we got married."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Diana said she confronted Charles about the bracelet, but the royal dismissed its significance and sentimental value, arguing that it was just a farewell present for a friend.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"So rage, rage, rage," Diana added. "You know, 'Why can't you be honest with me?' But no, absolutely he [Charles] cut me dead.
