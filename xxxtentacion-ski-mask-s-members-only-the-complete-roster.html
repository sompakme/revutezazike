With a sound unlike anything hip-hop&nbsp;has ever heard, the group's overall aesthetic is&nbsp;aggressive, distorted, and energetic. Their shows often incite some aggro-ass crowds, and sometimes escalate into straight up violence. It's commonplace to see group co-founder&nbsp;XXXTENTACION soaring through the air willy-nilly, falling into the eager clutches&nbsp;of his fans. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The group&nbsp;first formed back in 2015, when XXXTENTACION and <a href=# class=text-word rel="nofollow noopener">Ski Mask The Slump God</a> befriended each other in prison.&nbsp;From there, a musical chemistry was cultivated, which ultimately led to the first volume of their eponymous mixtape series. Since then,&nbsp;Members Only has seen many members come and go, including: Bass Santana, Flyboy Tarantino, DIRTYFACESMOOK, LxuiSavage, KiD TRUNKS, Kilo Jr., Fukkit, Vinny Chango$, SB, DylansVision & RyBundy.</p><p>One thing hasn't changed, however. The core group remains rooted by a sense of familial loyalty. Co-founder Ski Mask The Slump God <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told XXL</a>&nbsp;"Members Only is like everything in one, we're more of a family than just like, a collective, you feel me? If it came down to it, we'd just say fuck the music and try to be friends."</p><p>Love them or hate them, here is the current Members Only roster.&nbsp;</p><p><br><h2>XXXTENTACION</h2></p><p>XXXTENTACION & Ski Mask's "Members Only:" The Complete Roster</p><p>This man needs no introduction. XXXTENTACION&nbsp;has solidified his place in the rap game with his brash, unapologetic energy, evident in both his music and live performance. While his X's music is certainly divisive, his dedicate base of followers managed to score him a position as the final <a href=# class=text-word rel>XXL Freshman</a>, skyrocketing him into the mainstream spotlight.&nbsp;</p><p>The Members Only ringleader has been steadily releasing music for years now, and has recently dropped the musically eclectic&nbsp;Revenge&nbsp;project. Whether he's taking shots at Champagne Papi, doling out and receiving punches, or simply spitting bars, X has mastered the art of getting people talking. &nbsp;</p><p><h2>Ski Mask The Slump God</h2></p><p>XXXTENTACION & Ski Mask's "Members Only:" The Complete Roster</p><p>As one of the movement's forefathers, Ski Mask's contributions to Members Only are second to none. With a unique and versatile voice, Ski Mask has proven time and time again that he's got a clever mind for lyrics and an impressive array of flows. Sometimes he slows it down, shouting adlibs with a&nbsp;cartoonish, childlike innocence, while other times he simply goes in.</p><p>Like many Members Only artists, Ski Mask is somewhat of a chameleon. You'll never know what beats he's going to get on next, and while some of his music features that lo-fi&nbsp;production, he once named <a href=# class=text-word rel>Timbaland</a> as his favorite producer of all time.&nbsp;</p><p><h2>Wifisfuneral</h2></p><p>XXXTENTACION & Ski Mask's "Members Only:" The Complete Roster</p><p>While Wifisfuneral has had an on again/off again history with Members Only, a recent tweet suggests that he's back riding with the movement. After suffering an assault during a stage dive gone wrong, Wifi started making headlines for all the wrong reasons, and even <a href=# class=text-word rel>Joe Budden</a> clowned on him. Little did the haters know, however, was the simple fact that Wifisfuneral can spit bars. He responded to his detractors with "JoeBuddenProbablyThinksICantRap," and simultaneously silenced the critics who wrote him off as "mumble rap."</p><p>With a deep discography on both Soundcloud and Spotify/Apple music, Wifi is already proving himself as an artist to look out for.&nbsp;</p><p><h2>Craig Xen</h2></p><p>XXXTENTACION & Ski Mask's "Members Only:" The Complete Roster</p><p>Off the jump, Craig Xen stands out as the collective's most lyrically intense member. One visit to his Soundcloud page opens of a macabre world of psychopathy, murder, necrophilia, golden showers, and suicidal thoughts. His music and persona seem cut from the same cloth as horrorcore rappers like Necro, Mr. Hyde & even early Bizzare. Pair that with a hoarse, metal-esque screaming delivery and meet Craig Xen.&nbsp;</p><p>During class, Xen used to keep his headphones on and write poetry, before realizing he wanted to pursue music. Still, behind all the lyrical grand-guignol is a man who understands his position in the game, and takes his budding career very seriously.</p><p><h2>Stain</h2></p><p>XXXTENTACION & Ski Mask's "Members Only:" The Complete Roster</p><p>Stain has produced several hits for the Members Only collective, including Volume 3 cuts&nbsp;"What In XXXTARNATION?" and "Maxipads For Everyone!" In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with XXL</a>, XXXTENTACION described Stain as his"main producer...He’s a phenomenal guy, I love him. He fits me perfectly. That’s who I’m sticking to."</p><p>Citing XXXTENTACION, LUCKI, & Earl as some of his current favorite artists, it's clear that Stain has some eclectic tastes. His production is often loud, distorted, and lo-fi, which lends itself well to some of the group's more aggressive tracks. The co-sign from X has earned the young producer a spot in Members Only, and one of the collective's go-to producers.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnaIV6fIyxr7GslaPBoq%2FIqKVmmZ6ZerS3yGakmqubqHquscybnKurXaS7rcWMrZ%2BeZZOkurG4xK2cZqqfqMGmvoynnLCr</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
