The success of these young men can be attributed to the selfless teachings about faith from their mothers.</p><p>I remember as a child that my mother taught me to pray whenever I encountered doubts and fears. As a young teenager I was participating in a 50-mile hike that started at midnight in a small rural community in central Utah. After spending the night hiking around a mountain my group stopped at a checkpoint for breakfast. I was very tired and decided that I would not finish the hike if I stopped. I continued on the trail alone. After hiking a few hours I became lost and realized that I failed to get a map from my group.</p><p>After a brief period of intense fear and confusion I remembered my mother's advice to pray. I knelt down by a tree and prayed to my Father in Heaven for direction. I continued down a winding road and within an hour came across another group of hikers. I completed the hike and thanked my Heavenly Father that evening for answering my prayers.</p><p>Since that day the instruction and example received from my mother has helped me in countless situations. Mothers who teach their children gospel principles are developing the future stripling leaders of the Church. - Reed Markham, Glendale, California.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnJ%2BuqpOdu6bD0meaqKVfZoZ6gI5wZmtrX2eAc4GVcG1pZ5yew6q6xmaZsmWknbJuv8KroKmspaeytHmVamw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
