Similar to what he said to Big Boy, he wasn’t trying to pursue the path that Dr. Dre hoped he would head on. “... I wanted ladies to feel like maybe they could fix me, and I had done so many push-ups,” Fif told Melber with a grin. “So I felt like, ‘This is gonna be good for my love life!’ I’m dead serious.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It seems that it helped him out, considering that he ended up dating Vivica A. Fox and allegedly had a fling with Meagan Good in the years that followed. “I thought that they would see some way that they could possibly fix me or understand me in a different way,” he continued. “And their favorite line on the song was, ‘I love you like a fat kid loves cake.’ When I wrote it, I was thinking, I love you, but too much of you is no good for me. Like a fat kid loves cake.” Check the interview above.&nbsp;</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
