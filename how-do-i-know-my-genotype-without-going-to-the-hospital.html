Also, when you know your genotype, it helps a lot with health matters, and thanks to this knowledge, you can prevent some dangerous illnesses.</p><p class=align-left>First of all, you should know there is no need to determine the code of the entire genome, only snippets of it will be enough. The snippets of a genome are the rare DNA parts which make us different.</p><p class=align-left>For instance, they make some people blond-haired, while others are dark-haired. As far as the science is concerned, genetic scientists are aware of the existence of ten million different kinds of snippets, which means there are ten million differences in genetic sets in the world, maybe even more.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/570dd4d1898f0c76.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Major anime genres listed and explained: which one is right for you?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In this article, you will have a chance to learn about various types of genotype, and of course, if you can find out your type of genotype without going to the hospital.</p><h2>Types of genotype</h2><p class=align-left>Firstly, we need to learn what genotype is.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Genotype meaning:</strong> A genotype is the carrier of all genes that are located in the cell. The word genotype is used when we refer to genes which are inherited from ancestors to descendants. However, even those organisms that have the same genotype have a lot of distinctive features, which makes every person unique and different.</p><p class=align-left>A genotype is a system where genes perform interactions with each other, influence each other and form genetic combinations. Every gene has its own genotypic environment. By the type of interaction, the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">genotype types</a> can be the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Epistatic</strong> – those which suppress actions of various non-allelic genes.</li><li><strong>Hypostatic</strong> – genotypes which are suppressed by the allelic genes.</li><li><strong>Pleiotropic</strong> – those which simultaneously affect the manifestation of a few symptoms.</li><li><strong>Fatal </strong>– genotypes that can reduce the embryo’s viability, often to the point when it dies.</li><li><strong>Sublethal</strong> – those genes which do the same as fatal genes, but they cause the embryo’s death before the reproductive period starts.</li><li><strong>Modifiers </strong>– genes that can alter the manifestation of the other genes.</li><li><strong>Mutators</strong> – those which drastically change body signs and a person’s preferences.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ed7a169bdd97214f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best end of the world movies that are relevant today</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Apart from that, there are<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> four genotypes </a>that determine traits: AA, AS, AC, and SS. The anaemiaSS genotype means that the person will have sickle cell anemia, so you will have to research genetic compatibility before marrying your partner. The health of your <a href=#>future</a> children is another reason to go through the genotype test.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/570dd4d1898f0c76.png><h2>Genotype test procedure</h2><p class=align-left>Scientists find out new information about genotype every day, and there are a lot of impressive discoveries. Everyone knows for sure that sooner or later, genetic testing will become a popular procedure, which many people will want to undergo.</p><p class=align-left>A doctor will only have to look at the patient’s genetic map, and all the answers about the person’s characteristics will be clear. Besides, it will help those who need individual medicine for their particular diseases.</p><p class=align-left>Nowadays, it is quite difficult to find genetic specialists in Nigeria. However, people can find out their genotype through other innovative ways because science is moving forward, and people can learn about their genotypes even without going to the hospital.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f64103c5edb7085c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Different ways on how to prepare for quarantine</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If you prefer finding out your genotype with the help of a blood test, you can visit the hospital nearby, and the doctor will take the blood sample from your arm. When they have enough blood, they take it for analysis to the laboratory. The laboratory test determines the level of hemoglobin in your blood. Genotype can also be determined with the help of a skin or hair sample. This is usually how people undergo the DNA test that determines their relation to someone.</p><p class=align-left>However, there is an exclusive opportunity to undergo a complete professional genetic test, and you will not even have to go to the hospital for it. Read about the procedure below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ed7a169bdd97214f.jpg><h2>How to know your genotype without blood test?</h2><p class=align-left>You can also do the genotype test online. A person can donate their DNA for deep analysis to the company called 23andMe. <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Time Magazine</a></i> acknowledged 23andMe, calling it the Invention of the Year 2008.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/471200a3ff3a8d10.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 50 elephant tattoo ideas with meanings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>23 is the number that stands for 23 chromosomes, which contain genetic information about people. All you need to do is spit into the test tube and send it to the laboratory. You will be provided with your own personal genetic book with plenty of information about your ancestors, special features of your DNA, and other important facts that scientists could find out about you based on your saliva. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The test costs $99</a>.</p><p class=align-left>However, there are some countries whose laws forbid the transportation of saliva through the national border.</p><p class=align-left>There are a few laboratories in Nigeria that offer genetic expertise, but it is for a much higher price. However, if you are really keen on this idea, you can send your saliva in a tube from Nigeria to the United States, and get your genetic results on the official site of 23andMe.</p><p class=align-left>You will receive the instructions together with the test tube by mail. You will have to spit into the tube until you fill it – the instructions strongly advise you to rub your cheeks intensely for thirty seconds. When you have completed the process, you will have to shut the tube, and then send it back to 23andMe.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6d4a8858ce4e772c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Discover Double Stemcell benefits and side effects</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You will be sent the information about the illnesses that you are predisposed to according to your genes, and some health recommendations. Sometimes there is no serious news in this section, but if this is your case, you should be happy because it indicates that your health is good.</p><p class=align-left>There can also be information about the pills you are sensitive to. The genetic test will give you information about your genes, and sometimes your bloodline can be traced as far back as to the Neanderthal genes. This is one of the favorite features of those people who go through this genetic test because everyone would love to know which nationality they descended from.</p><p class=align-left>The 23andMe website also has a social network, where more than 200 thousand people can communicate with each other and search for their relatives. They also have the opportunity to meet new people.</p><p class=align-left>So, perhaps if you want to meet someone genetically compatible with you, you can use this website. This site also has a lot of interesting information about genetic studies.
