"I love it. Every second," he told <a href=#>People</a>, adding that his favorite thing about Lucian is "his smile." <a href=#>Weston Coppola, who looks just like the actor, praised his father's</a> granddad duties and shared, "Lucian is very rowdy. So we all take turns making sure he's stimulated. My dad loves him. He's a phenomenal grandfather." He also attributed his parenting skills to Cage. "I believe that a lot of the morals and philosophies that I will teach to my son definitely comes from my father. He was an amazing father to me," he told&nbsp;<a href=#>ET</a>&nbsp;shortly after his son's birth.</p><p dir=ltr>As noted by <a href=#>Hollywood Life</a>, Weston went on to have his second son, Sorin Reid, with his then-wife Danielle on May 29, 2016. Shortly thereafter, the couple split and Weston moved on with Hila Aronian. The two married in April 2018 and welcomed their twin daughters, Cyress Zara and Venice Zohar, in April 2020. Unfortunately, Weston's marriage to Aronian didn't last either, and his drama with his exes ended up involving Cage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtobIN2go6noJynnJbAbq%2FAoJxmn6KWu6Wvx6KjnaqVo3qpu9ZmpJqmqWKxsLHSZp%2BeZZiWw6Z7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
