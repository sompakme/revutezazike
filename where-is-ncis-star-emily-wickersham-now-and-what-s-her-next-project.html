So, where is she now and could she return to the drama?</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Eleanor Bishop's final moments on NCIS</figure><p id=eBFmczu0gmp data-wc=52>According to her IMDb page, Emily hasn't added to her list of screen credits since leaving NCIS&nbsp;and has no upcoming projects. We have a feeling that this could change fairly soon, however, as just two weeks ago she shared a screenshot of her camera roll, which was filled with self-tape auditions.&nbsp;</p><p id=eVelwTWdaNB data-wc=15><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Daniela Ruah shares glimpse of emotional last days on NCIS: LA as finale nears</a></p><p id=e3ZY0oZQcWS data-wc=7>She wrote in the caption: "<strong>Tape town</strong>."&nbsp;</p><p id=ezWp56NB8ca data-wc=29>Fans were quick to express their excitement in the comments section, with one person writing: "Omg r u acting again," while another shared words of encouragement, adding: "Book it!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/396cfde9cab3-emily-wickersham-instagram.jpg><p id=e0zdQiTtGqm data-wc=58>As for whether Emily could return to&nbsp;NCIS, her character's <a class=hm-link href=#>exit storyline</a> has left the door open. In season 18, Agent Bishop found herself in the middle of an investigation following an NSA leak. While she eventually admitted to leaking the documents, she later told Agent Nick Torres (Wilmer Valderrama) that she had compromised her position on purpose.&nbsp;</p><p id=eNf4wPWN2ZV data-wc=23>The agent explained that she had landed an undercover mission with the CIA, which required her to destroy her career at the NCIS.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/51092d6585d3-gettyimages-1230949542.jpg><p id=eA_Ym0Zk2pk data-wc=35>While Agent Bishop was alive and well when she left the service, Emily hasn't dropped any hints about a potential return to the drama, so we can assume that she won't be back anytime soon.&nbsp;</p><p id=ejVjEYYtPeT data-wc=58>So, why has Emily been away from our screens since leaving the show? It's possible that the actress took a break from acting after giving birth to her first child, Cassius, in December 2021. The 38-year-old welcomed her son with fellow actor <a class=hm-link href=#>James Badge Dale</a>, six months after the couple went public with their relationship in June 2021.&nbsp;</p><p id=erLNUGl72ra data-wc=15><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>NCIS star Emily Wickersham has a famous partner – and you'll definitely recognize him</a></p><p id=endeQp17ka1 data-wc=40>Emily often shares adorable snaps of Cassius and her partner James, who is known for playing Chase Edmunds in the Fox TV drama, 24, as well as for his role as John Dutton Sr. in the <a class=hm-link href=#>Yellowstone</a> prequel series, 1923.&nbsp;</p><p id=eb89E_B3tx6 data-wc=45>Back in February, Emily posted a sweet tribute to James and her son on Valentine's Day.
