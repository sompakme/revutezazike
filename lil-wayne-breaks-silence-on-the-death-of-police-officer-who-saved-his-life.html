I’ll love & miss u both and live for us all," Lil Wayne wrote.</p><p>Lil Wayne explained how Uncle Bob&nbsp;took him to the hospital after police discovered his body at his home when he was 12 years old. Though other officers attempted to find incriminating evidence, Hoobler rushed Lil Wayne to the hospital in his cruiser&nbsp;since there were no paramedics available in the area.&nbsp;<a href=# rel>Hoobler</a> revealed later on that an ER nurse said Wayne would've died from his injuries if they had waited for an ambulance.</p><p>Gonzalo Marroquin/Getty Images</p><p>Hoobler was found dead at his home in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana on Friday morning. The parish's coroner, Dr.&nbsp;Gerry Cvitanovich confirmed Hoobler's passing, though he did not confirm a cause of death.
