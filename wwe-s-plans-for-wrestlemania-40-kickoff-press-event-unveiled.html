This perception intensified, particularly when Cody Rhodes seemingly granted him a spot at WrestleMania 40. WWE will be holding their WrestleMania 40 kickoff press conference tonight and now the company’s plans for the event have been unveiled.</p><p>In case you didn’t know, The Rock also pushed hard for the&nbsp;<a href=#>WrestleMania 40 bout with Roman Reigns</a>. This is because The Rock wanted to save&nbsp;<a href=#>WrestleMania 40 as the match would be true big money affair</a>.</p><p>The Rock and The Tribal Chief are set to have a faceoff at the WrestleMania 40 kickoff press conference, which will take place in the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada tonight.</p><p>While speaking on <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Radio</a>, Dave Meltzer talked about WWE’s plans for the kickoff press conference. Meltzer noted that WWE plans to confirm Cody Rhodes, Roman Reigns and The Rock’s WrestleMania 40 plans during the event.</p><p>“When the thing (today) is over, whatever they’re doing, whether it’s a three-way – which I was told it was not going to be – but whether it’s them doing two matches where Roman wrestles twice, or how they make this thing work, I was told it will likely be completed by the end of the press conference, that is the plan. “By the end of the day we’ll know what’s going on as far as the card.”</p><p><a href=#>The Rock and Roman Reigns have already arrived</a> for the press event. We will have to wait and see what WWE will announce for the aforementioned WWE Superstars and hopefully, bring an end to all the controversy and outrage that has been brewing since last week.</p><p>What do you think of this story concerning the WrestleMania 40 kickoff press event?
