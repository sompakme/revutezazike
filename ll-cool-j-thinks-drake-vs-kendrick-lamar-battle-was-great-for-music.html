The back-and-forth between the two superstars has powered the entirety of hip-hop media in 2024. Every media personality has given their two cents on who won, and every legendary rapper has gone on a podcast to offer perspective. LL Cool J is one of the few who didn't have much to say about <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Drake vs. Lamar</a> while they were battling. Now that the dust has settled, though, LL has nothing but praise for both sides.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">LL Cool J recently sat down with Bootleg Kev to talk shop about the battle of the decade. The rapper clarified that he was coming at from a fan perspective, and was thoroughly entertained by what Drake and Dot put on display. "I thought it was great for hip-hop," he noted. "Thought it was the right thing. I thought they both did well, they held their own." LL Cool J did make a ruling on which rapper he thought won, though, and it was not a surprise. "I thought Kendrick won," he noted. "But I thought that Drake, by no means did he embarrass himself... He definitely showed up."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ll-cool-j-compared-the-rappers-to-lebron-and-steph>LL Cool J Compared The Rappers To LeBron And Steph</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">LL Cool J is a battle-tested veteran, himself. He's gone at Canibus and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Wyclef Jean</a> among countless others. He was happy to see that competition is still a big part of hip-hop's appeal. "The key to that stuff is as long it doesn't distract you from your ultimate goal," he stated. "It's a wonderful thing to participate in. I love it, man." LL took things a step further than comparing Drake and Kendrick Lamar to some of the great rivalries in sports. "This is no different from LeBron and Steph. Jordan, when he was coming in, and Magic was going out. It ain't no different."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">One rapper who LL has been less thrilled with, lately, is <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Andre 3000</a>. He recently gave his opinion on Three Stack's flute album, and told The Shop's Lena Waithe that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he was disappointed</a>. "I need him to spit," the rapper noted. "Flutes? Man, come on, bro. His bars is all the way up. Iâ€™m very clear. Not the flute, B. Not the flute." LL Cool J put his money where his mouth was, too. He just dropped the single "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Sat</a><a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">urday Night Special</a>" with guest appearances from fellow legends <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Rick Ross</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Fat Joe</a>.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Danilo is a writer based out of San Diego.
