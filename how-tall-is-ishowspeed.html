With a height of approximately <strong>5 feet 8 inches (172 cm)</strong>, he stands tall not just in stature but also in <a href=# rel>his achievements and influence</a> in the digital realm.</p><p>Darren Watkins Jr. embarked on his online journey in 2016 when he joined YouTube. Initially, he focused on gaming videos, and by December 2017, he began live-streaming his gameplay. However, the initial response was lukewarm, attracting only a couple of viewers. But perseverance pays off. From a subscriber count of 100,000 in April 2021, he skyrocketed to 1 million by June 2021 and an astounding 10 million by July 2022.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-turning-point>The Turning Point</h2></span><p>IShowSpeed chats with Sky Sports pitch side before the Premier League match at Craven Cottage, London.

Clips showcasing his intense reactions during live streams, especially towards games, players, and even his camera, began circulating on TikTok. These clips, often highlighting his animated behavior, transformed into <a href=# rel>viral online memes</a>. However, fame comes with its challenges. His intense outbursts led to bans from platforms like Twitch and even from the video game Valorant.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=# rel>IShowSpeed Net Worth 2023: What Is The Streamer Worth?</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-recognition-and-achievements>Recognition And Achievements</h2></span><p>LONDON, ENGLAND - JULY 08: IShowSpeed and Michael Dapaah aka Big Shaq attend the Strawberries & Creem and 2k management party at One Marylebone on July 8, 2023 in London, England.

A game called Talking Ben significantly contributed to his growing popularity. Years after its release, this mobile app climbed the charts to become the best-selling game on the App Store, thanks to Watkins' videos on the game.</p><p>However, it hasn't always been smooth sailing. In July 2022, he faced a near-disastrous situation when a Pikachu firework he set off almost ignited his bedroom. A month later, while live-streaming, he became a victim of a swatting attempt, forcing him to halt his stream. He even faced a brief incarceration, with Adin Ross stepping in to bail him out.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=# rel>iShowSpeed Back In Hospital Amid Frightening Health Scares</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-beyond-gaming-ishowspeed-s-foray-into-music>Beyond Gaming: IShowSpeed's Foray Into Music</h2></span><p>Watkins isn't just a gamer; <a href=# rel>he's a musician too</a>.
