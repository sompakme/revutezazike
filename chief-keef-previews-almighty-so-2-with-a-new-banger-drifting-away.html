Below, you can find the new track "Drifting Away." With the female vocal sample all the way throughout the track, fans are going to be reminded of "Save Me," which has that iconic <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Katy Perry</a> flip. That said, this song manages to stand on its own thanks to some incredible production and flows from Chief Keef that are going to have fans excited for what could be one of the best releases of the entire year.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-chief-keef-prepares-fans-for-almighty-so-2>Chief Keef Prepares Fans For "Almighty So 2"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">There is a lot of hype around this project, and fans are hoping that Keef comes correct.
