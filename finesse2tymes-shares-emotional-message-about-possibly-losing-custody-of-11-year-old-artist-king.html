Earlier this week, the rapper took to social media to reveal that King could be taken from him soon, sharing a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">heartfelt message</a> about their bond. According to him, the argument that King is in an inappropriate environment is invalid. He says that the boy was taking part in adult activities long before he came into the picture.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I ain‚Äôt gone lie , tryna take king from me got me kinda emotional üò™ Knowing I don‚Äôt mean nothing but well , When I first meet him I could see he was different , and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I just wanted to help him</a> I seen the dark road he was goin down," he wrote. "THE RAP SHYT MEANS NOTHING TO ME I HAVEN‚ÄùT MADE 1 SINGLE DOLLER OFF KING.

His post comes after <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">King's mother called CPS</a> on Finesse in March, claiming that she hadn't seen him since getting out of jail. At the time, he argued that he was giving the child a better life than he would have otherwise. He also accused King's mother of only wanting money "to support her habits."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of Finesse2tymes' <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">heartfelt message</a> about his artist King?
