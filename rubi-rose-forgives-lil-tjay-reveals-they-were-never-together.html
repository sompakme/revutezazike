The radio veteran asked Rose about the Tjay drama and what exactly went down. As Rose explains, what Tjay did was crazy, however, he was extremely apologetic after. Rose even went so far as to say that Tjay is a very good person and that he has completely forgiven him for the situation. From there, she noted that&nbsp;the two are not an item and that they weren't in the past either.&nbsp;</p><p>Rose also touched on her friendship with Lala Baptiste, which quickly evaporated following the Tjay altercation. After Baptiste appeared in a Tjay music video, the two had a falling out and Rose has not heard from her since.</p><p>It's good to see Tjay and Rose patch things up, especially since things looked pretty bad at first. Perhaps they can even do a song together, in the near future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkZ4B1g5Zmqa6amWK%2FsL%2FEZp2oqpeew6a%2FjKWgpWWkn666edGerZ6ZnKh6tbTEsmSwnaKaeq%2Bx1Z6pZqyfnLK1tMSrZKedp6g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
