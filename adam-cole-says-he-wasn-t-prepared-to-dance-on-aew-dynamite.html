Although a breakup might be evidently coming, the two were able to break into a memorable dance segment in the middle of a match, and that was quite a moment.</p><p>Adam Cole looked back on the memorable dance-off that took place during the Blind Eliminator Tag Team Tournament finals on the July 19th edition of AEW Dynamite. During the match, Cole and MJF faced off against Sammy Guevara and Daniel Garcia, and things kicked off with a spirited dance competition between the two teams.</p><p>While speaking on&nbsp;<a href=#>Chaz & AJ in the Morning</a>, Adam Cole reflected on the segment during that match. Mr. Bay-Bay said that he wasn’t ready to dance, but the moment still took him over.</p><p>“The truth is, I wasn’t prepared to dance. I’m here in the finals of a tournament, I’m ready to go. Max goes off on his own, he got a little excited and decided he wanted to have a dance off with Daniel Garcia, Sammy Guevara. I was in the zone. Seeing those guys bust a move, I felt the energy run through me. No one can say that I didn’t bring the energy.”</p><p>MJF and Adam Cole’s pursuit of the championship did not end in triumph, as they were unable to secure the AEW Tag Team Titles. FTR, consisting of Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler, managed to defeat Cole and MJF on the July 29th episode of AEW Collision.</p><p>We will have to see what MJF and Adam Cole do next. The two are still together in a team, and it’s anyone’s guess when they will break up. Obviously, the AEW World Title might be in play if and when that day comes.</p><p>What’s your take on MJF and Adam Cole’s tag team? Are you here for what they have in store?
