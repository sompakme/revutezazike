He left Hofstra University in 1945 when he was drafted into the U.S. Army; stationed in Japan, he started a newspaper for the troops.</p><p>After his discharge, he took a class in television production in 1948, and that led to a job at WPTZ-TV in Philadelphia as a cameraman (working studio shows, Athletics and Phillies baseball games and University of Pennsylvania football games) and a promotion to director.</p><p>In the 1950s, Behar helmed episodes of the NBC daytime sci-fi show&nbsp;Atom Squad, the soap opera The Greatest Gift and local programs starring Kovacs, including a two-hour weekday morning program that predated the Today show. (Kovacs had begun at WPTZ as a staff announcer.)</p><p>From 1955-58, he directed for NBC’s&nbsp;Wide Wide World, a Sunday travelogue series conceived by Pat Weaver and hosted by Dave Garroway. When the Rocky Mountains were obscured by a blizzard during one episode, he sent someone to a gift shop to buy a picture postcard for the camera to zoom in on, his family noted.</p><p>He relocated to Los Angeles in 1959 to reteam with Kovacs on several network shows.</p><p>The key to directing Let’s Make a Deal was capturing the contestants’ reactions, he said in a <a href=# rel=nofollow>2003 conversation</a> for the TV Academy Foundation website The Interviews. “Once a reaction was gone and you didn’t catch it, there was no way of editing it in or redoing it,” he noted. “But I was a wiz at getting it the first time.”</p><p>In addition to his wife of 53 years, survivors include sons Jeffrey, Steven and Greg and their partners Lori, Tim and Jennifer; grandchildren Alex, Mallory, Niko and Lydia; and great-granddaughter Brooklyn.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOo6asnaCdeqOxx5qpZpyVlrFusMCyqmanlmK8tr6MpaCvnaNitKa6xKuYpWWYpMCxtdOao2ZpYmiBeoSTa3BtZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
