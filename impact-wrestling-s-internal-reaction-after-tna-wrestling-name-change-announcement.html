The company is very happy about how things have turned out already.</p><p><a href=#>PW Insider</a> reports that Impact Wrestling officials were highly pleased with the predominantly positive online reaction to the return of the TNA name for the company. The wording used was that they are “over the moon” with the reception, so they are hitting the ground running with their rebranding efforts.</p><p>“Impact officials were over the moon with the mostly positive response online to return of the TNA name for the company last night. They are already selling a new “We’re Back” TNA logo t-shirt. The name will officially transition over as of January at the Hard to Kill PPV in Las Vegas. Hard to Kill will feature Moose challenging for the World title.“</p><p>The company has already released a new TNA logo t-shirt with the caption “We’re Back.” The official transition to the TNA name will take place in January during the Hard to Kill pay-per-view in Las Vegas, where Moose will challenge for the World Title.</p><p>It was reported that this is a well-thought-out move that was initially planned to be revealed at Slammiversary, but was rescheduled for Bound for Glory. The final decision to switch back to TNA was made about 2 to 3 weeks ago. Their AXS Television show will now be known as TNA Impact Wrestling</p><p><a href=#>We already covered whether that six-sided ring will return</a>. Odds are, they will keep the squared circle they have today, but the TNA Wrestling logo will be everywhere.</p><p>We will have to see how things pan out once TNA Wrestling really starts back in January. There are a lot of happy, nostalgic fans right now. It will be interesting if those rebranding efforts pay off for the company from this point on.</p><p>What’s your take on Impact Wrestling going back to TNA Wrestling?
