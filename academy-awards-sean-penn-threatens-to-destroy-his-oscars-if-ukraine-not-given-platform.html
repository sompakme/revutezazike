I myself, if it comes back to it, when I return, I will smelt mine in public.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/Itp7J34NFMxcmm61uhnwLK2Q9bg=/16x13/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/4P6DGN66DNSSAPBFJHPAFJGA3I.jpg"><p>"I pray that's not what happened.
