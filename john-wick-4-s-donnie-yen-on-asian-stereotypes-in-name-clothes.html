Why can’t he have a normal name? Why do you have to be so generic?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">And Yen wasn’t especially impressed that wardrobe originally gave his character mandarin collars. “Why is everything&nbsp;so generic? This is a&nbsp;John Wick&nbsp;movie. Everybody’s supposed to be cool and fashionable. Why can’t he look cool and fashionable?” he added about his Caine character.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">So, with some prodding, <a href=# id=auto-tag_john-wick-4_1 data-tag=john-wick-4>John Wick 4</a> director Chad Stahelski agreed to change the name and dress sense for Yen’s character. Not that the Hong Kong actor wants to knock his latest movie gig for disrespecting Chinese culture or playing safe with his character.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I had a very respectful experience working on&nbsp;John Wick.&nbsp;Overall, I enjoyed making the film,” he insists, adding that he feels Hollywood typecasting isn’t even conscious.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Reps for Stahelski and John Wick 4 have yet to respond to The Hollywood Reporter’s request for comment.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He recalled getting approached by Disney to appear in the 2016 Star Wars prequel Rogue One.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In the early drafts of the script, Yen’s character, Chirrut Îmwe, was the same generic martial arts warrior he recognized in staple Hong Kong movies. “One thing I pointed out is he was a stereotype. Typical master. Doesn’t smile,” Yen recounted.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Again, Yen approached the director’s chair to suggest his character might be blind and have a sense of humor. Getting permission to improvise jokes on set would also convert an otherwise cliché character into a possible standout performance onscreen.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">China-born Yen is a household name internationally thanks to his hugely popular and acclaimed&nbsp;Ip Man&nbsp;movie series, and he has crossed over to Hollywood with outings in&nbsp;Rogue One:&nbsp;A Star Wars Story, which grossed over a billion dollars, and Disney’s live-action remake of&nbsp;Mulan.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">So as a martial arts film icon, Yen isn’t someone to be ignored or toyed with on movie sets. He made a splash into the Hong Kong cinema scene when he starred in Yuen Woo-ping’s martial arts comedy&nbsp;Drunken Tai Chi.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He has influenced action movies across the globe and has become a major figure well beyond the world of Chinese action cinema.&nbsp;His talent also extends beyond acting in movies to producing, directing and choreographing projects as well.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Against that career achievement, and barring on-set freedom and creativity, Yen isn’t especially interested in Hollywood roles these days. “If I’m not allowed to have my creative control, it’s not worth my time,” Yen told GQ after earlier turning down roles in The Expendables and DC’s Aquaman.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKu7x6dksKGToHp1ecOopaehlWLGprqMmqqimZ5iwLWx0Z6mrbGgmsBuusCmnGabnKTBqbHSZmhra2VogHp%2Bk2lm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
