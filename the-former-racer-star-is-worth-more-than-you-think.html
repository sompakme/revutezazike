With a long list of records and accomplishments that any driver would envy, her talent on the track has helped her earn an undeniably impressive amount of money. <a href=#>Forbes</a> notes that "Patrick's personal endorsement portfolio remains the envy of the sport," which is why she took the #7 spot on the list of NASCAR's highest-paid drivers in 2017 with $12.2 million. She also made the list in <a href=#>2018</a>, taking the #8 spot with $10.3 million, which was also when she decided to retire from professional racing at 36 after a 14-year career, per <a href=#>Fortune</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Patrick wasn't about to take it easy following her retirement from racing. In fact, she has a number of other money-making pursuits to keep her busy. <a href=#>The New York Times</a> points out that she "has a book, Pretty Intense, to sell, plus a clothing line called Warrior, and her Somnium brand of wine."</p><p>"None of my other businesses are linked with racing necessarily â€” other than it being me, and that's what I did, and that's given me everything I have, from awareness to the houses I own and the life I get to live," Patrick told the Times in May 2018. That life includes a fortune that Celebrity Net Worth reports is in the range of a whopping $60 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2pnaoB2e8OapaKbkWK9osDRopqkq12jsrV51qipraBdqbWmecWoqaadomK%2Foq%2FEq2SsrJGneqq%2FjLCmq6yYYrqwvsRmq6GZnmLGsMGMrZ%2Bipptk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
