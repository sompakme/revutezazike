It marked the first time a female superhero was the protagonist, with Brie Larson stepping into the role. Furthermore, its 90s setting helped establish some crucial MCU lore and set up the important context for the upcoming Secret Invasion series. The film was well-received, holding a 79% critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes. However, it suffered from malicious review-bombing over its female protagonist and feminist themes.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, while a sequel was greenlit soon after release, little was known about what direction "Captain Marvel 2" would take. Captain Marvel herself became a side character in Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. Meanwhile, an adult version of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Monica</a> Rambeau, who was a child in Captain Marvel, played a major role in Disney+'s WandaVision. But with the Avengers moving toward Kang, and the blockbuster comic storyline Secret Invasion headed to the small screen, Captain Marvel's future was unclear.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-captain-marvel-and-ms-marvel-set-to-team-up>Captain Marvel And Ms. Marvel Set To Team Up</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Marvel Studios dropped the first look at The Marvels on April 11. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Set for release in November 202</a>3, the film will see Captain Marvel and Ms. Marvel, star of the Disney+ series of the same name, team up in a science fiction buddy comedy. The film stars Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Brie Larson as Captain Marvel, Teyonah Parris as Monica Rambeau, and Iman Vellani. Furthermore, British actress Zawe Ashton has reportedly been cast as the film's primary villain.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The teaser trailer provides a basic overview of the plot as well as the film's overall tone. Captain Marvel, Monica Rambeau (also known as Captain Rambeau), and Ms. Marvel must team up in order to discover the reason behind why they are suddenly able to switch places with one another, as well as switch powers. Consequently, the film is expected to be heavy on comedy. A primary plot point will be the contrast between the stoic Captain Marvel with the teenage fangirl Ms. Marvel. The trailer also shows Goose, the tentacle-shooting alien disguised as a cat. Additionally, The Marvels will be the third film in Phase Five of the MCU. It also serves as the studio's final cinematic release of 2023.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Benjamin Mock (they/them) is a sports and culture writer working out of Philadelphia.
