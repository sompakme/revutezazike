While some have criticized the teenager for making herself appear older than she is, much of the backlash she's faced – on TikTok especially – has been regarding her love for rap music. She was compared to Kentucky lyricist Rubi Rose earlier this year after previewing a new song on the platform, but now, one of her latest videos has the internet slamming the young blonde.</p><p>On Monday (May 15), Barker confidently rhymed along to lyrics like "We ain't together, when I'm wit' him he know I'm the realest / I ain't no opposition, all these bitches in their feelings." Rather than her signature platinum locks, the fashionista wore a bright orange wig, seemingly channelling <a href=# class=text-word rel>Ice Spice</a>. She left one blonde streak in her bangs and obviously overlined her lips with a dark pencil, causing some to leave comments online about her obviously altered appearance. Elsewhere, others have been questioning her decision to pursue rapping when her father, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Travis Barker</a>, is one of the most famous rockers in the world.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel>Travis Barker's Teen Daughter Alabama Compared To Rubi Rose After Previewing New Rap Song</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-alabama-barker-faces-more-criticism>Alabama Barker Faces More Criticism</h2></span><p>"I don't understand how white girls be rich and decide to do this? The way I would be at a pool spending money somewhere, like what?" one hater wrote on Twitter. "The girls are really getting good at their Black girl cosplay. Like they are really committing!" another sarcastic response says. Offering up a half-compliment half-critique, a user wrote, "Ngl the wig colour is a good ass colour, but it would be cool if she didn't do that thing where she spends the next 10 years copying Black women from the south."</p><p>Regardless of what the haters are saying, plenty of TikTok users chimed in with kind words under the wannabe rap diva's post, encouraging her to keep pursuing her dreams.
