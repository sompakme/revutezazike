However, the interaction was rather low-key, as Williams recalled that Murphy didn’t say a word to him but simply gave a thumbs-up.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Fallon went on to ask about the fact that the You People performer was seen on camera standing up and applauding when Williams <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>won his award</a> later that evening for supporting actor in a television series. Murphy was at the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>ceremony to accept</a> the Cecil B. DeMille Award.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Lights are really bright, so I can’t really see anything, and I don’t know how people talk through that award wrap-it-up thing because it starts blinking immediately,” Williams recalled of taking the stage to accept his prize. “So I’m just trying to get off of stage as fast as I can, and it wasn’t until I got back to my seat that there was a bunch of text messages of people saying, ‘Eddie stood for you.’ And I was like, ‘What does that mean?’ And then they sent me the photo, and I’m still trying to process this.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">At that point in the conversation, Fallon held up an image of Murphy giving the standing ovation. Williams continued, “So I spent the next three or four days after the Globes trying to get in contact with Eddie Murphy to say, ‘I didn’t see you — I’m so sorry. But you mean the world to me.’ So I’m just now processing the Globe because I spent so much time trying to process that.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Fallon then said that Murphy is known to watch The Tonight Show, leading Williams to look into the camera and thank the Beverly Hills Cop star for the gesture.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOrbClnaJit6K5xKxksKGcobaiudJmnJ2cmZp6rsHRqZ%2ByZZekuaWxzWaepaeSmsBuv9OapZ2hnpx6sMLAraCopl1mf3SBkmpub3BpZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
