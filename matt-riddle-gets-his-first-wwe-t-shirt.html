WWE waited until Riddle was ready and now that the King Of Bros is in NXT everyone is waiting to see what his next step is.</p><p>It looks like WWE is putting the marketing machine behind Riddle because they just gave him a sick t-shirt. WWE’s design team obviously put a little more work into this design because it is unique.</p><p>Now you can wear a shirt that says “Original Bro” on it. There is a very cool little feature where it says “EST 2015” which is when Riddle actually made his jump to pro wrestling on February 7, 2015, at the&nbsp;Monster Factory&nbsp;in&nbsp;Paulsboro, New Jersey.</p><p>If this t-shirt sells as well as it should then WWE might get a clear message that Riddle needs much more attention. Samoa Joe and AJ Styles are two other examples of their debut t-shirts flying off the shelves so WWE gave them a much bigger focus.</p><figure class=wp-block-image></figure><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
