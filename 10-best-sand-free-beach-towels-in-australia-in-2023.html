She is passionate about finding and recommending fashion items that are great quality and value, ensuring you can wear them for years and save money in the long run. Her interest in skincare came from first-hand experience of searching for the best products for acne-prone skin and trying a long list of products in the process. Since joining the team she has tested everything from hair tools to jeans (spoiler alert: she loved them both).
