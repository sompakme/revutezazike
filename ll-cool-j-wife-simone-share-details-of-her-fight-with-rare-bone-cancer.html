"I was working out with my trainer, walking, talking, not paying no mind, walked into the wastebasket and it hit that little knot," <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">she told ET.</a>&nbsp;"That sent me to the doctor, and that's when I found out I had a chondrosarcoma&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">stage three tumor</a> in my right tibia bone." She had her right tibia removed during a 15-hour surgery and it was replaced with her left fibula, a rod, screws, nails and micro veins from her other legs. "It was a two and a half year recovery, where I had to learn to walk again. I went from a wheelchair to two crutches, to one crutch to a cane."</p><p>Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">LL and Simone have been married for 23 years and he made sure that he did everything to help aid in her recovery, including keeping negative energy out of their home and asking to give her one of his bones. "I remember sitting in the doctor's office, and he wanted to give his fibula bone...because he felt that his fibula bone would be bigger and stronger," she said.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I learned that you got to be grateful, and you <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">can't take things for granted</a>. I learned that left turns could come, right turns could come," LL said. "You can't always see around every corner, but you just&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">have to have faith</a> and you have to have gratitude, you got to roll with humility, you got to believe. I believe in God strongly, and you got to believe in yourself too."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Have faith,"&nbsp;Simone shared. "Find your inner strength.
