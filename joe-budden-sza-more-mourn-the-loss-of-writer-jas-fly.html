"<span>Many of us are in a lot of pain tonight," he wrote on a photo of Jas, "and the person who would know the perfect thing to say to brighten our spirits has gone home..... i love you, trust you and will miss you.. Rest peacefully Queen Jas."</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">SZA also paid tribute to Jas on social media by retweeting one of her old tweets with a kind message. "You had a purpose before anyone had an opinion," Jas had written back in 2015. "Remember that. And when asked 'who do you think you are?' answer 'whom I was created to be.'" SZA quoted this wisdom with, "Thank you for your time here and honest perfectly put words. Rest in Love queen."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Fellow writer Issa Rae&nbsp;took to Twitter as well to tell a story about the first time she got an interview with Jas.
