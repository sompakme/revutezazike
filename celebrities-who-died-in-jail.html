Unlike producers of the past, Spector was seen as an auteur, bringing a unique approach, dubbed the "Wall of Sound" to dozens of records that ended up being hits. By doubling or even tripling the sounds of the instruments and applying a thick wash of echo, Spector invented a loud, rich sound that had previously gone unseen in the music world.</p><p dir=ltr>The Wall of Sound spawned many imitators, and some musicians still use the technique today, many years after Spector's shocking fall from grace. On February 3, 2003, Spector met a nightclub hostess named Lana Clarkson, according to <a href=#>The New York Times</a>. He invited her back to his home, but the night ended with Clarkson dead in Spector's foyer. According to testimony by Spector's chauffeur, who was waiting nearby, he heard a pop and then saw Spector emerge with a revolver in his hand, uttering the words that would ultimately guarantee his prison sentence: "I think I killed somebody."</p><p dir=ltr>During a drawn-out legal process with Spector looking increasingly disheveled, his first trial, ending in 2007, resulted in a hung jury, but a second trial that ended in 2009 resulted in Spector's conviction and imprisonment. In early 2021, after more than a decade of incarceration, Spector died on January 16th due to complications resulting from the COVID-19 virus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCCkm9scm5fmLKtscGroK2hlah6uLTOZpuinZRitq95yZqgpWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
