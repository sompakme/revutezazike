He’s a big, strong, tall boy and it’ll be nice to work together with him along with ‘Redders’ (Sydney FC goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne).</p><p>“He can bring that competition as well.”</p><p>And while Gauci will soak up Ryan’s experience and nous, the Socceroos captain said he himself could also learn from the Reds’ keeper.</p><p>“I always believe that you can learn something from anyone, so I’m sure I could learn something from him and from all the other young boys who are coming in as well,” Ryan said.</p><p>“I’m really looking forward to this youthfulness that is going to be coming in, this energy that we’ll get from that as well, and seeing what exciting talent can come in and make the most of their opportunity and make us stronger.”</p><p>The youth brigade also includes Gauci’s Adelaide teammate, Nestory Irankunda, the 17-year-old whiz-kid who will join the Socceroo squad as a train-on player.</p><p>“It’s only good for us as a national team that these guys are taking their opportunities and fingers crossed he can continue with that (A-League) form,” Ryan said of Irankunda.</p><p>“If he is an inquisitive guy, hopefully the other senior boys in the group can have an impact and influence on him to raise his game and that he can become an even better player from being in (the Socceroos camp).”</p><p>Ryan also praised fellow Socceroo and Adelaide captain Craig Goodwin for “mentoring” Irankunda at club level.</p><p>“He’s got his arm around his shoulder and he’s sharing his experience,” Ryan said.</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Adelaide data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Adelaide</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ70qmmq6xfm7ywwMGao6Vno6SwpLHRqKasZZOWvbWtyKdkrJmpqHq6u9Snnmafn5a5rLHEqZyrZaeeua15wJ2bZp2emr%2BoxYytpmamkam2sLrApWStnZGifK%2Bx1qxkrKyfp8ZwrpBya5tpaZuGdYGQcGueaJaYf6KAlHJva21lZa%2Bjf5g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
