The actress made a surprise announcement on social media Wednesday, revealing that she had given birth, though it was not widely known that the Wonder Woman star was even pregnant.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“My sweet girl, welcome,” Gadot, 38, shared on Instagram and Facebook. “The pregnancy was not easy and we made it through. You have brought so much light into our lives, living up to your name, Ori, which means ‘my light’ in Hebrew. Our hearts are full of gratitude. Welcome to the house of girls. Daddy is pretty cool too.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Gadot married Jaron Varsano in 2008. Since then, the couple has expanded their family by welcoming daughters Alma in 2011, Maya in 2017 and Daniella in 2021. “I love giving birth,” Gadot once said. “I would do it once a week if I could. It’s so magical. And I always take epidurals, to be fair, so it’s not painful. Just the moment you feel like you’re creating life, it’s incredible.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She has also said that she prefers to keep her family life “as private as possible.” As such, she did not share any pregnancy images ahead of Ori’s birth nor were there any reports that she was expecting. Gadot last starred as Rachel “Nine of Hearts” Stone in Netflix’s 2023 spy action thriller Heart of Stone. And she next appears as the Evil Queen in Disney’s Snow White, set for release in 2025, with Rachel Zegler as the titular princess.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvLop2eq6SuuaZ5zZ6urGeXlrlus8Cdpq1lkpavunnGoqmlZZ6WuqZ5zqugZqCVl7%2Bmw4yboKusmGKur7rOrqWcnZ2au7V5kGtqbnBkaYR2go4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
