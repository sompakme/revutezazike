The series, written and illustrated by Gege Akutami, follows the adventures of Yuji Itadori, a high school student who becomes a jujutsu sorcerer after swallowing a finger of the legendary cursed spirit Sukuna. Along with his friends and mentors, Yuji battles against various curses and enemies that threaten the world.</p><p>The manga has been serialized in Weekly Shonen Jump magazine since March 2018 and has been collected into 24 volumes as of December 2022. The series has also spawned an anime adaptation by MAPPA, which aired its first season from October 2020 to March 2021, and a prequel movie titled Jujutsu Kaisen 0, which premiered in December 2021. A second season of the anime was announced to premiere in July 2023.</p><p>But what about the manga? When will the next chapter of Jujutsu Kaisen be released? And what can we expect from it? Here’s what we know so far.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jujutsu_Kaisen_Chapter_240_Release_Date></span>Jujutsu Kaisen Chapter 240 Release Date<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to the official website of Weekly Shonen Jump, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jujutsu Kaisen</a> chapter 240 will be released on October 29, 2023.

The chapter will also be included in the 25th volume of the manga, which is scheduled to be released on November 4, 2023.</p><p>However, it is possible that the release date of chapter 240 may change due to unforeseen circumstances, such as holidays, natural disasters, or health issues of the author. In fact, Jujutsu Kaisen has been on hiatus several times in the past due to Akutami’s health problems or personal reasons. The most recent hiatus was from June to August 2022, when Akutami took a break to recover from poor physical condition. Therefore, fans should always check the official sources for any updates or announcements regarding the manga’s schedule.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Jujutsu-Kaisen-Chapter-240-Spoilers-and-Raw-Scans.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jujutsu_Kaisen_Chapter_240_Spoilers_and_Raw_Scans></span>Jujutsu Kaisen Chapter 240 Spoilers and Raw Scans<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Spoilers and raw scans for Jujutsu Kaisen chapter 240 are not available yet, but they are expected to be leaked online a few days before the official release date. Spoilers are usually posted by fans who have access to early copies of the magazine or by scanlation groups who translate the raw scans into English or other languages. Raw scans are the original Japanese pages of the manga that have not been edited or translated.</p><p>However, spoilers and raw scans are not reliable sources of information, as they may contain errors, inaccuracies, or fake information. They may also ruin the enjoyment and excitement of reading the official version of the manga. Therefore, we advise fans to wait for the official release of chapter 240 and support the creator by reading it from the legal platforms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Jujutsu-Kaisen-Chapter-240-Predictions-and-Expectations.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jujutsu_Kaisen_Chapter_240_Predictions_and_Expectations></span>Jujutsu Kaisen Chapter 240 Predictions and Expectations<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While we don’t know for sure what will happen in chapter 240, we can make some predictions and expectations based on the previous chapters and the current arc of the manga. The current arc is called Culling Game Arc, which started in chapter 143 and is still ongoing. It revolves around a deadly game that involves killing cursed spirits or other participants in exchange for points that can be used to make wishes or extend one’s lifespan. The game was created by Kenjaku, a mysterious sorcerer who possesses Geto’s body and plans to merge all humans with Sukuna.</p><p>In chapter 239, we see Yuji and Choso infiltrating an underground facility where they encounter Uraume, one of Kenjaku’s allies who can manipulate ice. Uraume attacked them with a barrage of ice spears, but Yuji managed to dodge them and reach Uraume’s location. However, Uraume revealed that they had set a trap for Yuji, as they had placed a cursed spirit bomb inside their body that would explode if Yuji touched them. Uraume then taunted Yuji about his inability to kill humans, even if they were enemies.</p><p>Meanwhile, Megumi and Panda were fighting against two other participants of the culling game: Hana Kurusu and Jin Itadori. Hana was a former classmate of Megumi who had a crush on him, but she became obsessed with killing him after he rejected her. Jin was Yuji’s distant relative who had a grudge against him for being Sukuna’s vessel. Hana used her curse technique to manipulate plants, while Jin used his curse technique to manipulate blood. Megumi and Panda tried to reason with them, but they refused to listen and continued to attack them.</p><p>Based on these events, we can expect that chapter 240 will continue the battles between Yuji and Uraume, Megumi and Panda, and Hana and Jin. We may also see how Yuji will deal with Uraume’s bomb, and whether he will be able to overcome his hesitation to kill humans. We may also see how Megumi and Panda will handle their opponents, and whether they will be able to convince them to stop fighting or defeat them. We may also see some flashbacks or revelations about the past or motives of the characters, such as Uraume’s connection to Kenjaku, Hana’s obsession with Megumi, or Jin’s hatred for Yuji.</p><p>Additionally, we may also see some scenes of the other characters who are involved in the culling game, such as Gojo, who is still sealed inside the prison realm; Yuta, who is guarding the prison realm from outside; Tsumiki, who is Megumi’s sister and a participant of the game; Maki, who is recovering from her injuries after killing most of the Zenin clan; Nobara, who is in a coma after being wounded by Mahito; and Sukuna, who is waiting for his chance to take over Yuji’s body.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jujutsu Kaisen Chapter 232 Spoile</a><a href=#>rs</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Conclusion></span>Conclusion<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jujutsu Kaisen is a thrilling and captivating manga series that has captivated millions of fans around the world with its unique blend of action, horror, comedy, and drama.
