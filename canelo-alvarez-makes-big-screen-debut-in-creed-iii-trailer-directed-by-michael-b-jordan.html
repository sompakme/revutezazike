Jordan's diretorial debut. As part of the <strong>Rocky </strong>franchise, Creed has managed to create a life of its own with a complete trilogy happening already. Although <strong>'Creed II</strong>' wasn't as critically acclaimed as the first one, this new story seems far more personal for the titular character as he faces a friend from his childhood that will be played by <strong>Jonathan Majors.</strong></p><p>In the trailer, <a href=#><strong>Canelo </strong></a>appears with <strong>Adonis Creed's</strong> family during a red carpet event. Back in the middle of September, it was announced that the <strong>Mexican </strong>boxer was cast to play himself in the movie with an unspecified role. But making it to the trailer could mean he does have a more prominent role in the movie. If you blink, you'll miss <strong>Canelo </strong>in the trailer.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Jonathan Majors will play Damian</h2><p>The actor that had his big break in <strong>Spike Lee's</strong> '<strong>Da 5 Bloods</strong>' from 2020 is getting another role as a villain with <strong>Michael B. Jordan</strong> as his opposite in the film. From what we could see in the trailer, <strong>Majors plays Damian</strong>. Who seems to be <strong>Creed's</strong> childhood friend that got into some sort of trouble and ultimately imprisoned.</p><p>Given that <strong>Creed </strong>didn't seem to do time in jail, it appears <strong>Majors </strong>took the fall and that got him to do almost two decades behind bars. This already seems like a back-to-basics kind of story for the Creed franchise that sadly won't have <strong>Sylvester Stallone</strong> reprising his role as <strong>Rocky Balboa</strong>. Just last year, Stallone himself explained why he wasn't returning as his legendary character for this movie.</p><p>During a small exchange with <strong>Metro UK</strong>, <strong>Sly</strong> revealed that the story <strong>Michael B. Jordan</strong> was going to tell was going in a different direction. It doesn't follow the story of Rocky and Stallone had to step down from the project. This is what the legendary actor said: "Well it's different because, actually, I bowed out of that one, I just didn't know if there was any part for me. It takes it in a different direction. I wish them well and keep punching!" Despite not acting in the film, <strong>Stallone </strong>remains a producer of the new <strong>Creed </strong>installment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6mpq%2Bhlah8c3yRa2ZqaF9mhXCCkm2daWlhbIF3fZVsnW%2BZZmeFo4CUmmpnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
