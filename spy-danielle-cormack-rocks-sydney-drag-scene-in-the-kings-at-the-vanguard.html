He literally did catch fire on a film set in a stunt that went horribly wrong but that’s another story.</p><p>“You might’ve already slapped your eyes on his burnt rump … Ponyboi graced screens in the hit budget underground, soft porn, straight to video <i>21 Pump Street</i>, where he played the titular character, Johnny Deep.”</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Cormack shared the company’s post and her fans went crazy, hoping they would see Cormack indulging in her other favourite pastime, riding her Harley-Davidson.</p><p>Since starring on <i>Wentworth</i>, Cormack has grown a huge international LGBTQIA+ fanbase and has attended Comic Con-styled fan events worldwide.
