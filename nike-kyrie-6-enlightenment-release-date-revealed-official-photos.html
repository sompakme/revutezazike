As you can see from the official images below, the shoe is mostly purple thanks to a multi-material upper. From there, red, blue and yellow highlights are placed throughout the sneaker. Perhaps the most interesting part of the shoe is the back heel which is all red with an eye watching your every move. Simply put, this particular colorway describes Kyrie to a T and if you're looking for some colorful sneakers to wear on the court, these are a great option.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">According to Sneaker News</a>, these are dropping on Saturday, December 7th for $130 USD.
