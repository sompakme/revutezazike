And FYI, he uses a very offensive term to describe the gays. The term (which begins with an F) is a term we can’t bring ourselves to use in this post.</p><p>Immigrants of course are those from other parts of the world who in this context come to live in the United States.&nbsp;And the ones he calls out specifically are ‘Iranians’, which <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="we (opens in a new tab)" href=#>we</a> interpret as all Arabs.&nbsp;And regarding the gays, he accuses them of “spread(ing) some [expletive] disease”, which most likely is a reference to HIV/AIDS.&nbsp;His actual beef with these groups is something along the lines of believing they are afforded certain privileges which they do not deserve.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.songmeaningsandfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/One-in-a-Million-lyrics2.png><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Third Verse</h3><p>This brings us to the third verse, where the singer denies being a ‘radical or racist’ based on the fact that he is rather a “small-town White boy just trying to make ends meet”.&nbsp;In other words, he presents himself as a humble dude whose primarily goal is basic survival.&nbsp;And he is uninitiated in the ways of the outside world (i.e. urban America).&nbsp;And perhaps more to the point, he is indeed uninterested in anything besides ‘just making his living’.&nbsp;Owing to this, he wants absolutely, positively nothing to do with the aforementioned types of individuals.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Song’s Title (“One in a Million”)&nbsp;</h3><p>The title of this song is derived from the chorus, where he is referring to the addressee as “one in a million”.&nbsp;This is a common idiom which points to the idea of how unique and valuable a person is.&nbsp;But outside of that the meaning of the rest of the chorus, as well as how it (and the title) relates to the song in general, is not abundantly clear.&nbsp;But going out on a limb, perhaps he is speaking to another “small-town White boy” or someone like himself.&nbsp;And on top of trying to raise that individual’s self-esteem, he also seems to be addressing the subject of drug abuse, as in such a person being prone to engage in such a behavior.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Release Date of “One in a Million”</h3><p>“One in a Million” originally came out as part of Guns N’ Roses second album “G N’ R Lies”, which was published by Geffen Records on 29 November 1988.</p>');var c=function(){cf.showAsyncAd(opts)};if(typeof window.cf !== 'undefined')c();else{cf_async=!0;var r=document.createElement("script"),s=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];r.async=!0;r.src="//srv.tunefindforfans.com/fruits/apricots.js";r.readyState?r.onreadystatechange=function(){if("loaded"==r.readyState||"complete"==r.readyState)r.onreadystatechange=null,c()}:r.onload=c;s.parentNode.insertBefore(r,s)}; })();<p>“G N’ R Lies” was featured on the deluxe reissue of Guns N’ Roses first album, “Appetite for Destruction” (1987), in 2018. However, this time around it was&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>decided by</a>&nbsp;Geffen Records and indeed Guns N’ Roses themselves to leave “One in a Million” off of its playlist.</p><p>The release of “One in a Million” also caused a tiff between Guns N’ Roses and Living Color, a rock band made up of African-Americans, when the two groups briefly worked together in October 1989.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Who wrote “One in a Million”?</h3><p>The song was written by Guns N’ Roses frontman, Axl Rose. “One in a Million” was produced by the well-traveled heavy metalist, Mike Clink.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Cover of “G N’ R Lies”</h3><p>The creative cover of “G N’ R Lies” (which resembles a newspaper’s front page) features Axl Rose’s “apologies to those who may take offense” to the lyrical content of “One in a Million”.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Slash was initially against this song</h3><p>It should perhaps also be noted that one member of Guns N’ Roses,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Slash</a>, actually has an African-American mother.&nbsp;And whereas he eventually made peace with “One in a Million, at first he did try to convince Axl Rose not to do the song.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Axl Rose addresses the N word used in “One in a Million”</h3><p>Axl Rose&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">eventually admitted</a>&nbsp;in 1992 that the racist lingo in this song was directed towards “some Black people that were trying to rob” him.</p><p>Outside of that, another reason he decided to use the N-word was due to it being taboo for White people in particular to say. According to him, he felt was a limitation on his freedom of speech.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Axl Rose’s beef with the Police and the Gay Community</h3><p>As the song insinuates, Axl Rose actually does have an extensive history with law enforcement,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">particularly&nbsp;</a>from his childhood days in Lafayette, Indiana.</p><p>Also his tiff with homosexuals apparently sprang from an incident in his youth where a gay man (whom Axl met while hitchhiking, with hitchhiking being referenced at the beginning of the song) actually&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tried to rape him</a>.&nbsp;Moreover Rose has stated that he has ‘had his share of dealings with aggressive gays’, which is what pissed him off.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvNoKSemZ6eu6i%2FwKebn5mTqcBvr86mZqCtnqh6r3nRqKqeq12ku6Z5yKdkmmWdnrmttc6nZKWxop6wtHnMnpinoZ6cfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
