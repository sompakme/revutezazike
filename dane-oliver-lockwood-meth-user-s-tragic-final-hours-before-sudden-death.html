The other part, the drug affected part, was not helping him.”</p><p>As Mr Lockwood began to appear threatening, security was required to restrain him, and he was given sedatives.</p><p>But about 20 minutes into the ordeal, Mr Lockwood appeared cyanotic and had no pulse.</p><p>CPR was administered, but he was later pronounced dead.</p><p>Mr Lockwood had been battling an addiction to methamphetamine for years, and had attempted to get clean many times between 2007 and 2019.</p><p>In 2018, Mr Lockwood had reconnected with an old childhood friend, who helped him gain employment as a pool technician.</p><p>He started going to the gym, and was extremely health conscious, as his new job required him to lift heavy weight, including bags of salt and chlorine drums.</p><p>But between mid 2018 and the start of 2019, Mr Lockwood‘s personal life deteriorated – he separated from his partner, lost his job with his friend and started drinking again.</p><p>About two weeks before his death, Mr Lockwood’s Narcotics Anonymous sponsor said Mr Lockwood had been using meth every day.</p><p>“This was the heaviest period that I have seen him using in the way he was,” he told the Coroners Court.</p><p>Despite Mr Lockwood’s struggle with his addiction, he had tried to overcome it many times, relying on support from family and friends.</p><p>On August 19, 2019, Mr Lockwood had taken more meth, and had started acting erratically.</p><p>A close friend saw Mr Lockwood had posted some concerning videos on his Instagram page, and contacted him to see if he was okay.</p><p>Mr Lockwood had really wanted to stay clean, and even told his friend he wanted a “normal life” before he died.</p><p>“All I want is to live; I just want a normal life and a job and a family,” Mr Lockwood had said.</p><p>An autopsy performed by Dr Melissa Thompson revealed his cause of death was methylamphetamine toxicity.</p><p>“It was reasonable to conclude that the struggle for over 20 minutes in a physical manner put further pressure on his already drug affected body and would have contributed to his death in this case,” Dr Thompson said.<br></p><p>Deputy State Coroner Erin Kennedy agreed the cause of death was meth toxicity, with antecedent causes relating to his resistance to restraint.</p><p>“Dane’s death highlights that significant changes are required for those who are brave enough and invested enough to seek help for serious drug addiction.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7zZqroqeelrlwutKwZJqbpGS6psDHZqysnaKoeqe1zZqjZqCfqr%2B0ecGenaiqlWLAtrDDnqVmnJWWwal7zZ6urGWjqbyzxY6dZ29plJeGcbKTn2hpb5KbfXqCj21wcG2Ul4R2g5JxnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
