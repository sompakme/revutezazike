While people were confused about what he could offer, <a href=#>the real reason Derek was a mentor on American Idol</a> was that he could teach the singers about stage presence.</p><p>He was instrumental in helping <a href=#>Nicolina open up in her villain’s song</a> from The Little Mermaid and gave a lot of good advice.</p><p>However, what he did for Christian Guardino was special.</p><p>Derek knew that Christian was struggling with his confidence, but he felt there was no reason for it. To prove to Christian that he was doing great, he asked if he could call a friend to listen to the performance.</p><p><a href=#>Derek then made a FaceTime call</a> to Michael Bublé and had the award-winning singer listen to Christian sing his version of Circle of Life from The Lion King. Bublé was impressed and had nothing but praise for Christian, who went on to perform the song on the show.</p><p>The next week, Christian sang his next song and then Ryan Seacrest said he had a surprise for him. He played a video sent in by Michael Bublé, where the singer said he would like to come on American Idol for the finale and sing a duet with Christian.</p><p>Of course, Christian was ecstatic and said yes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Christian talks Michael Bublé wanting to sing with him</h2><p>After Christian was eliminated later that night, he was still over the moon about this big opportunity.</p><p>He took to Instagram where he wrote, “I have learned so much, grown as an artist & gained new family for life AND I get to perform with the legend&nbsp;@michaelbuble.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>On top of this amazing opportunity with Bublé on the American Idol finale, Christian also started moving on with his career.</p><p>Just yesterday, <a href=#>Christian released a new single called Higher</a> and released it on all streaming platforms, so if fans want to help him move up the charts, they can listen to the song and show the former American Idol contestant some love.</p><p>American Idol airs on Sunday nights at 8/7c on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ52esKmtxKVkm62SobJuv8innqKml2KxtrHTZq6irJhirq6x0aKamqZdnrGwuIycpqeslajBorrTZqanZZaeu6K4xGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
