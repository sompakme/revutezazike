In the end, the couple went their separate ways just a month after their finale episode aired.</p><p>In a 2004 statement released to Extra (via <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>) at the time, Palmer said, "Jessica and I shared an incredible romantic journey on the show that began with a friendship that remains strong today. We simply realized that, individually, our next steps take us in different directions." While that all sounds relatively amicable and drama-free, the former NFL star did admit on "<a href=#>George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight</a>" eight years later that he was left heartbroken by the split.</p><p>Palmer said, "Well, that was devastating. The last part of that, when I was 24 years old and realizing that was not going to work out, that was tough." Asked if he'd "give[n] up on love," however, he went on to quip with a laugh, "Yeah, and on life. I'm slowly bouncing back. In my old age now of 34, I'm still trying to turn the corner." Of course, the separation proved to be a blessing in disguise as, in 2020, Palmer <a href=#>walked down the aisle</a> with the true love of his life, Brazilian model Emely Fardo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcGtjZYFxe9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5yZ6qrJ1dpa6tucSrZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
