The TV personality was married to model <a class=hm-link href=#>Lara Stone</a> between 2010 and 2015 and they share a six-year-old son, Alfred, together. <strong>David has addressed questions on his sexuality several times in the past, most recently in an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Attitude magazine</a> in 2017.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0bbeab7f2b9c-lara-stone-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=erSOqPi49MMB data-wc=7><strong>David Walliams and his ex-wife Lara Stone</strong></p><p id=e36E0dGTV4Ms data-wc=69>When asked if he is attracted to men, the star replied: "It's a bit of both. I don't know why anyone would rule [a relationship with a man] out. Why would anyone say that's never going to happen?" He added: <strong>"I do love women and I'm attracted to women but sometimes I think it would be simpler if I wasn't - because people think I'm gay and I'm camp."&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eFpBGuIx1yBr data-wc=32>In the same year, David told : <strong>"I had gay experiences growing up, which I enjoyed. I was a teen and in a lot of all-male environments.

He said: "I think it's all about falling in love with the person and that is overlooked, really."</p><p id=e1P371XBxqEE data-wc=58>He continued: <strong>"I hate it when people 'confess' or 'reveal' their sexuality and also things can change for people over the years. So it is about the person but I also think it goes beyond that. </strong>You don't just fall in love with someone's body, do you? You fall in love with someone's soul and heart and brain."</p><p id=ec6hsNGg6Kse data-wc=59>In a 2009 appearance on , host Kirsty Young asked the comedian: "Have you ever had a relationship with a man?" He replied: "No. If I fell in love with a man then, yeah, I wouldn't say that could never happen. I think about it; because I am effeminate I've always thought about it, 'Am I gay?'"</p><p id=e6vKvy-QDTRQ data-wc=43>&nbsp;He also revealed: "If I was gay, I would just get on with it. But definitely I love women, <strong>I love being around women, I find them incredible and intoxicating, and I've never had that feeling I get with women with a man."</strong></p><p id=eL6nu6__Ucb4 data-wc=14></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yRaWdyamZuhHp%2FlWibmq6ZmXq4rculoJqlo2LBorjKrGSsnaiqrq2107Jkq52clsGqu82sn6Koo2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
