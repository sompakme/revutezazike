Wranglin' with Phone Calls in a Texas-Sized Custody Showdown</h2><p data-sourcepos=3:1-3:366>So you and your ex done wrangled yourselves a custody agreement, yeehaw! But hold your horses, there's still some critters rustlin' in the barn â€“ phone calls! Can the custodial parent, bless their heart, just hightail it out of dodge and block the other parent's number from reachin' their young'un? Well, let's saddle up and ride into the dusty plains of Texas law.</p><p data-sourcepos=5:1-5:37><strong>The Law Don't Play Telephone Tag:</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:397>Now, Texas ain't exactly fond of parents playin' telephone tag with their kids, especially when there's a court order involved. <strong>Unless there's a mighty fine reason,</strong> like a history of varmint behavior (think threats or abuse), the judge likely won't take kindly to one parent blockin' the other out. <strong>Kids need both their mama and daddy,</strong> even if things got a tad bit rocky between you two.</p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:55><strong>But Sheriff, What About Them Pesky Excessive Calls?</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:452>Hold on there, buckaroo! We ain't sayin' you gotta put up with an ex who calls more often than a chatty magpie. If those calls are comin' in like a herd of stampedes, makin' life miserable for you and the little tyke, then there's a solution. The good folks in the family court can help wrangle up a <strong>phone schedule</strong>. That way, everyone knows when to expect the hootin' and hollerin' of a phone call, and there ain't no room for misunderstandings.</p><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:36><strong>Think Before You Block, Partner:</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:116>So, before you go hittin' that block button like a rattlesnake on the warpath, take a deep breath and consider this:</p><ul data-sourcepos=17:1-19:0><li data-sourcepos=17:1-17:166><strong>The Kiddo's Best Interest:</strong> This here is the biggest critter in the whole rodeo. <strong>Does blockin' the calls truly benefit the child, or is it more about you?</strong></li><li data-sourcepos=18:1-19:0><strong>The Court's Mighty Hammer:</strong> If you block calls without a good reason and there's a court order involved, well, the judge might not be too happy. You could end up wearin' a metaphorical Stetson of shame (and maybe even pay some fines).</li></ul><p data-sourcepos=20:1-20:29><strong>The Bottom Line, Partner:</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=22:1-22:424>Texas law prioritizes a child's relationship with both parents. Unless there's a clear and present danger, blockin' calls ain't the answer. If communication's gone loco, talk to your lawyer about a phone schedule or other solutions. Remember, sometimes the best way to handle a custody situation is to take a deep breath, channel your inner peacemaker, and focus on what's best for that little buckaroo you both cherish.</p>2188079257183653913<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWrGWtnZOdfHN8kW1maWxfmK6vecKuqq2nlJ6urXnPmqmepqRir627wqRkqaCfo7Jur8Clo6xmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
