It's becoming more common for people in unconventional relationships to come forward with their stories or to live their truths out loud through plural marriages or polyamorous romances. While this isn't the traditional norm, reality shows like Sister Wife or Seeking Sister Wife have introduced poly lifestyles to the masses. It seems that Trick Daddy and his wife have followed suit...sort of.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">On Love & Hip Hop Miami, Trick and his wife Joy have placed their relationship issues on display, but despite the breakup-to-makeup moments, they have a solid friendship. His wife has stated publicly that she wants to be divorced, but Trick doesn't want that to happen.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">During a chat with The Breakfast Club, Trick revealed that both he and Joy have broken up and he "allows" her to date other people.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"The only way I&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">ever get divorced</a> [is] if my girl want me to marry her," he said of his girlfriend. "In my mind, I'm like a <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Duke</a> point guard...one and done." The hosts clarified that he only wants one marriage and that's all. When DJ Envy brought up his wife wanting the divorce, Trick added, "That's what she say. If she want a divorce, she need to stop using my name."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Then, she going around messing with all these dudes trying to find me. I'm right here. They'll never be me," he said. Angela Yee mentioned that Trick and Joy have "been separated for a while" and both of them have their own relationships while remaining married. "She going to hell with me," Trick answered.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">That's adultery!</a>" the rapper continued. "I allow her to date, but now, I need to start evaluating these dudes who you mess with 'cause these are my boyfriends and husbands-in-law... You need to take care of my wife. They need to do what they need to do."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">You can watch Trick Daddy explain this for himself below.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
