But the song came out a year before the pair started dating, so anyone paying attention would know that's not the case. Afterward, Mayer dated songster Vanessa Carlton for about a year, per <a href=#>Wonderwall</a>, and she later called him a "bad breaker-upper."</p><p>Mayer's big mouth struck again big time while <a href=#>dating Jessica Simpson</a>, who he infamously told <a href=#>Playboy</a>&nbsp;is "like crack cocaine to me," calling her "sexual napalm." Whoa dude! At least <a href=#>he regrets</a> saying it.</p><p>Brief relationships followed with Cameron Diaz, Minka Kelly, and Jennifer Aniston, but perhaps the most infamous of <a href=#>Mayer's past girlfriends is Taylor Swift</a>, who may or may not have written her 2010 song "Dear John" about him. Per <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>, Mayer was "humiliated" by <a href=#>the song</a>, in which Swift sang that she was "too young to be messed with" (she was 19 to his 32), but she has never said officially who the song is about.</p><p>Mayer's longest and most recent relationship was with Katy Perry, who he dated from 2012 to 2014, and again in 2015, before she found love with Orlando Bloom. His 2017 song <a href=#>"Still Feel Like Your Man"</a> is "pretty plainly" about Perry, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>The New York Times</a>. He told the Times, "Who else would I be thinking about?" Hopefully, the Casanova will find love again now that he's older... and hopefully more discreet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG1laH94e9ahpmaZopp6q7vHp2Smmamav7R5xZqkqK2jYrK5ecaiqaWeop6yr7DSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
