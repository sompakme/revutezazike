This certainly didn’t fare well for the already <a href=#>shaky marriage</a> between Christina and Henry.</p><p>During a chat with pastor Cal, Henry pointed out some dishonest behavior from his wife.</p><p>On their wedding day, the brunette beauty told him that she lived in the CBD (Central Business District).&nbsp;But when it was time for them to visit each other’s homes, Christina’s belongings were in her car!</p><p>This, Henry said, was one of many things she’s been dishonest about since they’ve been married.</p><p>“I’ve noticed a pattern of dishonesty. I noticed it kind of early on, and I kind of let it slide by,” Henry said. “But I think it kind of prevented me opening up to her early on and just talking to her.”</p><h2>Is Henry Gay?</h2><p>Henry said that’s not the case, and there’s absolutely no reason to think otherwise.&nbsp;However, Christina thinks this is the reason her husband has no interest in her.</p><p>During the last episode, the <a href=#>Season 11 castmember</a>&nbsp;dropped a bombshell on her husband, questioning his sexuality.</p><p>Henry shared in the episode, “When I got home, Christina kept on implying that there’s a specific reason as to why things aren’t working out.</p><p>“And I said, ‘I’m very confused. If you think I cheated on you, if you think I’m dating somebody else, I’m absolutely not doing that at all.’</p><p>“And so, eventually, she told me that a ‘quote-unquote’ reliable source texted her — a male — that he and I were, um, he and I were allegedly sleeping together. <a href=#>And that I was gay</a>. I told her that it was absolutely not the case.”</p><p>Henry says Christina did not show him the alleged text messages, and he questions if she’s lying about this as well.</p><p>“I don’t know if she’s making it up,” Henry said. “I don’t know if she really received a text. I have no idea why she was making this accusation.”</p><p>Married at First Sight airs Wednesday nights at 8/7c on Lifetime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5moeqmxzauwZp6ipLpuucCrqaKdlGKutXnFoqmsrF2otqi002aemrFdn8K0wIyopZ5ln5t6tbTEZqOinaNisKm%2ByKyroqaRYsCitcNmmJunpal6qbHRZqSanqNitba%2FwZqlnWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
