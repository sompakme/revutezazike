Additionally, he was beloved by all of the players and coaches he interviewed. Over the years, <a href=# rel>Sager was a staple of NBA On TNT's coverage</a>. He was always standing courtside, ready to interview the biggest names in the sport. Although he interviewed some people at their lowest moments, he was able to get people to crack a smile. When he passed away a few years ago, it was a huge loss to the basketball community.</p><p>Going back to Sager's suits, he was always wearing something truly unique. The patterns and the fabrics on his menswear would always get a ride out of people. Even though not everyone was a fan of his looks, they couldn't help but deny that Sager pulled it off immaculately. Having said all of this, it should come as no surprise that Jordan Brand once made a Craig Sager Player Exclusive. Although it was never released officially, there are still some images of it online.</p><span></span><p>Subsequently, we now have some detailed shots of the shoe, courtesy of @EnglishSole on Instagram. As you can see up above, this shoe is tremendous, although certainly not for everyone. It is impossible to truly describe this shoe from head to toe. Overall, this is because each section of the shoe features its own unique pattern. Of course, this all represents Sager and his magnificent suits. He never wore the same thing twice, and that is absolutely represented here. Every time you look at this shoe, you are going to come across something new. Most sneakers don't give you that feeling, however, these definitely do.</p><p>Unfortunately, you will never be able to purchase these. Jordan Brand has no plans for an official release, and that is probably for the best. These are not mass appealing, and a release would ruin their mystique. At least for now, we have these images to look at whenever we want. Let us know what you think of this sneaker, down in the comments below.
