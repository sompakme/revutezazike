The flywheel is attached to the crankshaft at the back by bolts. You will almost likely be impossible to spin the flywheel over by hand unless you have removed the spark plugs from the engine (to reduce compression) before starting the engine. In order to “jog” the motor, you’ll need to utilise the starter.
