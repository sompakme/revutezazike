As a spokesperson for the brand, Carter attended a 1982 event at the company's headquarters in Memphis. Maybelline happened to be owned by a drug company and client of Altman's Washington D.C. law firm (via <a href=#>The Washington Post</a>). A well-meaning matchmaker, Maybelline exec R. Lee Jenkins, invited Altman to a dinner that was being held for Carter while they were all in town.</p><p dir=ltr>Altman told&nbsp;The&nbsp;Washington Post that while he recognized Carter as "a good-looking actress" and Maybelline model, he had planned to just go back to his hotel and watch football on TV. "I thought the last thing I need is to go to dinner and get mixed up with some Hollywood actress," he admitted. And although Carter thought of most lawyers as "dull," the unlikely pair hit it off immediately. "There was a strong and immediate attraction, even to the point that we were so very interested in one another that it seemed rude to the rest of the table," Altman told the Post.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>While neither had been expecting it, the dinner meeting spawned a whirlwind romance. Within three days after their initial meeting in Tennessee, Altman called Carter at her home in California. By that time, the actress and model admitted she was already "head over heels." The couple's long distance romance culminated with a proposal on the French Riviera a year after they met, and six months later they tied the knot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG1pbIJ2e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2hxq%2BwwGaamqqkmr%2B0ecuaq55lmKrAo63NnWSrp5Kav7V5wKWrppmeZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
