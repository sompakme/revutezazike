Their father has continued to have ongoing public controversies, including his arrest and conviction for armed robbery in 2008 (per <a href=#>The Guardian</a>). Not to mention&nbsp;retrospective documentaries and dramatizations of his trial for the murder of Nicole Brown. Both have fueled interest in what became of the couple's children&nbsp;â€” and what their present-day relationship with O.J. Simpson might be like.</p><p>Georgia Newsday mentioned an alleged fight between Sydney and Simpson, during which Sydney is supposed to have accused him of killing her mother. Elsewhere, tabloids have shared various unverifiable claims. The <a href=#>National Enquirer</a>&nbsp;pointed to unnamed sources claiming Sydney was sure of her father's guilt, but forgave him and sought to make peace with him during his incarceration. In 2019,&nbsp;<a href=#>Radar Online</a> quoted her ex-boyfriend as saying that Sydney and Justin believed their mother was killed in a spoiled drug deal. Such claims remain rumors.</p><p>The siblings haven't made any public comment on their father's innocence or guilt. <a href=#>Radar Online</a>&nbsp;quoted their aunt, Tanya Brown, as saying the now-grown children are leading happy and normal lives. She allegedly claimed they have probably discussed the issue with each other, but don't discuss it with family. "It's the pink elephant in the room that I hope never shows up," said Brown. "We don't talk about it." Simpson himself told AP (via <a href=#>USA Today</a>) that he still has a positive relationship with his children, and they don't discuss their mother's fate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9k3FnbnFnZMSprdOerZ6qXZ2usbzEp5ydZZ%2BferS1zKmqqKZdo7aku8ueZJuqn6y7br%2FIpqesp55iuKqw0mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
