The site notes that this is a combined worth with her husband of over 40 years, hotel heir Rick Hilton. While the bulk of their fortune most likely comes from Rick's inheritance, Kathy's entrepreneurial spirit has been with her since childhood.</p><p dir=ltr>Kathy was just 5 years old when she took on her first business venture, selling flowers out of her family's garden. In the '80s and '90s, she ran an antique shop called The Staircase on Sunset Plaza, and in 2002, she began selling household items and skincare products on QVC and HSN. "Kathy likes selling," Rick told <a href=#>The Wall Street Journal</a>, "so she would dominate." And Rick was right, as she sold out of some products after her first on-air appearance.</p><p dir=ltr>But Rick is not the only one to commend Kathy's business acumen. When Kathy launched her own line of party dresses in 2012, Colleen Sherin, the senior fashion director at <a href=#>Saks Fifth Avenue</a>, told <a href=#>The Oklahoman</a>, "She's very smart in the way she's positioning the collection. She understands the realities of what many women can spend on evening wear."</p><p dir=ltr>The Oklahoman reported that Kathy "also has her eye on bedding, furniture, costume jewelry and more," and with increased exposure from <a href=#>The Real Housewives</a>, the time may be ripe for her to embark on a new entrepreneurial adventure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbHBhaYF0e8qaq6GxXZ22rcDOp6pmppWperi70a2fZqyYmnqztM6bn2arpJa%2FbrXSZq6oqqSdeq670Z5kraCRo3q6u9Rmq6GhnqB8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
