Yes, warm <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-vanilla-perfumes/>vanilla</a> and gourmand scents fit into the cozy vibe of the colder months, but there's nothing like rose, iris, or lavender scent to inject a bit of spring energy into one's day. And my flower of choice recently? Jasmine.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandra-balahoutis-2ab67a24/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Alexandra Balahoutis</a>, perfumer and founder of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://siperfumes.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Strange Invisible Perfumes</a>, jasmine is "an anytime, anywhere sort of scent." She says, "It's really good for lifting spirits, increasing alertness, and it's an aphrodisiac, so it's a very useful essence if you're trying to start some romance," adding that she associates the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-perfumes/>fragrance</a> most strongly with love.</p><p>"It's kind of nice because there's something sentimental about it—it's floral and it's sweet, and it isn't trying to be cool," she says, but contrasts it with florals like rose and iris, which have a more "prim, Victorian" reputation. "But at the same time it's very exotic and worldly, and it has a lot of backbone."</p><p>Indeed, jasmine has its <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.britannica.com/plant/jasmine-plant referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>origins</a> in Iran, and has also been grown in India, China, Morocco, Egypt, and elsewhere. It has since spread across Europe and North America because of its alluring scent (and the delicious tea it makes), and it can now be found as far from its home as Southern France and sunny Los Angeles.</p><p>Jasmine perfumes are a staple in any fragrance lover's collection. "I almost think there wouldn't be any perfumery without jasmine," Balahoutis admits. "It's a heart note, and it's aromatherapeutic."</p><p>But there are so many jasmine scents on the market—not to mention so many variations of the scent—that it can be challenging for the uninitiated shopper to find a jasmine perfume that works best for them. Thus, we've asked Balahoutis to break down how to shop for in a jasmine perfume. Plus, we've researched countless jasmine fragrances to bring you the best ones all-around.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-to-look-for-in-a-jasmine-perfume><span>What to Look For in a Jasmine Perfume</span></h2><p><strong>Type of Jasmine</strong></p><p>Did you know that there's more than one type of jasmine? And the type you pick can drastically change the character of your fragrance.</p><p>"There are two types of jasmine that are mostly used in botanical perfume," Balahoutis explains. "One is called jasmine grandiflorum, which is the typical jasmine that we’re used to. It’s got a little more depth to it; it’s kind of a bit creamy and buttery. Then, jasmine sambac is a bit more of a top note. It’s a bit brighter, and it has almost more of a berry scent." In contrast, she says that jasmine grandiflorum "can strattle the base note and heart note worlds"—though these aren't hard and fast rules, and both types of jasmine find themselves falling "all over the map" in terms of top notes, heart notes, and base notes.</p><p>And still, both types bring the romance.</p><p>"They’re both night blooming flowers, so they’re definitely associated with the night and the heart chakra, and they just have a very rich, unapologetically sweet, floral scent," she says, adding that even so, jasmine works on all genders.</p><p><strong>Scent Pairings</strong></p><p>"There are so many things that jasmine carries with beautifully, with which is why it's such a predominant ingredient in fragrances," says Balahoutis. "It pairs really beautifully with sandalwood and with rose. It smells really gorgeous with bergamot and citruses. It goes beautifully with so many different essences."</p><p>She also adds that jasmine and ylang ylang pair wonderfully, as the latter can enhance jasmine's "mood-boosting" qualities.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-best-jasmine-perfumes><span>The Best Jasmine Perfumes</span></h2><a href=# data-model-name="Strange Invisible Perfumes Fair Verona" data-url=https://siperfumes.com/products/fair-verona referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x27WYh54wLLCnw87iTNNRG-1920-80.png></p></a><p>Strange Invisible Perfumes Fair Verona</p><p>"In Fair Verona is definitely the jasmine lover's delight in our collection," says Balahoutis of this option, which channels romance in both composition and in name. "That is the first fragrance we go to when we think of jasmine. It's inspired by Romeo and Juliet, and the composition is around 80 percent jasmine, and then it has iris, some Italian citruses, some sandalwood, some myrtle, and some other elements to sort of season it and make it really unique.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>expert-approved; potent; small batch; made from natural botanicals; made with organic grape alcohol</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>low projection/lift, according to some reviewers</p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong>"Starts off with heavily indolic jasmine. The jasmine calms down within the first hour (although I detect it throughout the 6-8 hours of wear) to an incredible, very realistic rich white floral. Then the powdery mimosa and creamy, incense-y sandalwood warm up, both bringing a little green/stemmy character into the mix while also grounding it. The cardamom and grapefruit are both there as well, giving the barest hint of spiced citrus.One of my favorites! I agree with another reviewer - this is a masterpiece. As with all Strange Invisible Perfumes' fragrances, projection is low—I happen to like this, but something to be aware of if you prefer high projection perfumes." -Fragrantica</p><a href=# data-model-name="Diptyque Olène Eau de Toilette" data-url=https://www.nordstrom.com/s/diptyque-olene-eau-de-toilette/7231325 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/75786/1960196/23920?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fdiptyque-olene-eau-de-toilette%2F7231325" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=nordstrom.com data-merchant-id=480139 data-merchant-url=nordstrom.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/osvar6mvqfE4kU28ypeunP-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>Diptyque Olène Eau de Toilette</p><p>Between their candles and their fragrances, Diptyque is one of the most beloved scent brands right now, and even sits at the top of our list of the <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/french-fragrance-brands/><u>best French fragrance brands</u></a> right now. Celebrities from Meghan Markle to Beyoncé have extolled the virtues of this premium, aesthetically pleasing brand, and I can’t blame them—especially when it comes to fragrances like Olène. Inspired by the Roman goddess of flowers, Flora, Olène draws from the smell of decadent Venetian gardens, relying on jasmine along with wisteria, honeysuckle, and narcissus.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>popular scent and brand; lots of lift</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>some reviewers say it doesn't last very long</p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong>"I've purchased these perfumes not long ago, but absolutely love the fragrance.

However, it doesn’t have that headache-inducing quality that so many floral fragrances have, because notes of apple, pear, and bergamot give it a light, airy quality, while hints of musk and white woods ground it and keep it sticking to you all day long.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>lasts long; editor-approved</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>too floral for some</p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong>"My number one issue with perfumes is that they dont last, and im extremely picky with my scents.

There is no essence in it that's completely out for itself, but it does have quite a bit of jasmine. It also has ylang ylang.
