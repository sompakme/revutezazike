Just last week, Cynthia revealed that she and Cole were staying at the COMO Parrot Cay resort for their anniversary.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a28dd8895d95-cole-hauser-wife-cynthia-vacation.jpg><p id=esS6MvOiOMK data-wc=30>Posting the most romantic photos, Cynthia could be seen cuddling up to Cole on a beautiful beach at sunset, before sharing a kiss. The caption read: "28 yrs together… @colehauser22".&nbsp;</p><p id=e8t1U42yLJJ data-wc=36>Described as "an award-winning private island resort," Parrot Cay is made up of beach houses, villas and multi-room residences, each with a private pool, and access to the resort's white sand beach, which stretches four miles.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0ad690646a90-cole-hauser-wife-cynthia-kiss-on-beach.jpg><p id=eP40D80IK35 data-wc=40>It was unclear whether they were joined by their three children – sons Ryland, 18, Colt, 14, and daughter, Steely Rose, 10 – on the trip, but seeing as it was their anniversary, it was most likely a couple's retreat.&nbsp;</p><p id=e5q5reCtkDV data-wc=35>While fans have loved seeing Cole's adventures with his family, many are also wondering when he'll return to the set. Back in July, Kayce Dutton actor Luke Grimes confirmed that production remains on hold.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4f32c8d7657c-yellowstone-beth-and-rip.jpg><p id=e08Y8vHEeaS data-wc=52>Speaking to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>PEOPLE Magazine</a> he said: "We have not [started filming the second half of season 5] because of the writers' strike. I think we would be if it weren't for that. But that takes precedence over everything. They've got to get that all sorted, and then we'll be getting after it." &nbsp;</p><p id=eTSaYaIDX8_ data-wc=38>As well as Yellowstone, the labor action has also stalled the production of the second season of 1923, helmed by Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren, as well as the development of the upcoming Yellowstone spinoff starring Matthew McConaughey.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Everything you need to know about the cast of Yellowstone</figure><p id=ePXMfRqv5QN data-wc=59>In the meantime, however, Cole will be busy working on his new coffee company, which he officially announced last week. Revealing all in a heartfelt caption, he wrote: "I am excited that the news is finally out there on something special I have been working on for years. My coffee company, Free Rein, is coming to everyone this Fall.&nbsp;</p><p id=eZVDB7uX63N data-wc=35>"I hope this company and its message inspires men and women from all walks of life to get up and chase after their dreams and ambitions. @freereincoffeecompany Just Remember- Dreams don't work unless you do!"&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
