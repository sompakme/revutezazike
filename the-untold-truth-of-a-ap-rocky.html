Telling&nbsp;<a href=#>GQ</a> that he was excited about fatherhood in May 2021, he said, "If that's in my destiny, absolutely," before quipping, "I think I'm already a dad! All these motherf***ers are already my sons — whatchu talkin' 'bout!" But he then added, "Nah, but like, I think I'd be an incredible, remarkably, overall amazing dad. I would have a very fly child. Very."</p><p dir=ltr>Turns out that very fly child is on its way. In late January 2022, the couple revealed that they were expecting, according to <a href=#>People</a>, when they were spotted in New York City with Rihanna's baby bump peeking out from her puffer coat. For her part,&nbsp;Rihanna also talked about babies with <a href=#>Vogue</a> in March 2020 after recognizing that her hectic work schedule wasn't sustainable. "I'm [realizing] life is really short," she said. "You don't have a lot of time to tolerate s**t, you know? You put so much on your plate. When you're overwhelmed, you need to start cutting things out. And I'm overwhelmed too much."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Rihanna added, "What's happening now is that I'm going back to black and white. My [gray] area is shutting down." So, what did this mean for her future? It meant working hard so that she could take a step back later on — and that step back included a family, as she added, "I'll have kids — three or four of 'em."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam1paYJ2e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5wKyYqWWipLCsxY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
