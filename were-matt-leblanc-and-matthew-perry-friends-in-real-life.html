As LeBlanc told <a href=#>People</a> in 2015, he considered the whole crew to be his family.&nbsp;"Courteney [Cox] and Lisa [Kudrow] are like my big sisters, but [Jennifer Aniston is] like my little sister," he told the outlet. "Matthew's like my little brother, and David [Schwimmer]'s like my big brother."&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, as LeBlanc pointed out, how he views each of his former castmates is relative to their ages. Schwimmer, Cox, and&nbsp;Kudrow are all older than him by one, three, and four years, respectively, and Aniston is younger than him by about two years. Perry, who was the youngest of the cast, was also about two years younger than LeBlanc.</p><p>Perry echoed LeBlanc's sentiment during the "Friends" reunion special in 2021. "The best way that I can describe it is after the show was over, at a party or any kind of social gathering, if one of us bumped into each other, that was it," he recalled. "That was the end of the night. You just sat with the person all night long and that was it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcXBoa4B6e8CrnGalkanBbrjEm6OappNirq%2BwjKaYrayYmsRuvMSrqbJllqe2prrDrGSipl2nsqK4jKWgn51f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
