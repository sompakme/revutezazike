"Just because you don't understand something does not make it wrong or does not make people wrong. I don't even understand all of it, but I'm willing to ask questions. I'm willing to align myself to get close to, so that I can understand. Just like I didn't understand Spanish, but I got close to it and learned to speak it. French. Japanese. Musical instruments. Math equations. You don't understand these things so you lean in. You ask questions. You inform yourself."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Yet, there is a trans woman named Mariah who shared a lengthy story on her Facebook page, accusing the actor of trolling areas and picking up trans child prostitutes.&nbsp;In a post titled "Surviving Malik Yoba: We had sex, when I was just a teen," she&nbsp;claims that she encountered him 20 years ago when she was 13-years-old. "What Malik paid me to do, as a 13 and 16 year old, wasnt love," Mariah wrote. "His ignoring that I was clearly a child prostitute, wasn’t love. Paying for cheap thrills and secret orgasms; begging for unsafe, unprotected sex from a runaway Trans teen, while enjoying stardom as a successful artist and business man ....isn’t love."
