Creating songs as a young artist wasn't cheap, and Wilson worked as a Hannah Montana impersonator when she booked performances in high school, according to <a href=#>The Boot</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>When she was a teenager, a man from her hometown asked her to sing during the grand opening of his convenience store, per <a href=#>Billboard</a>. "He gave me $20 and I sang all 10 of my songs I had written at that point, and I actually still have the $20 bill," she said. Once she moved to Nashville, she lived in a "bumper-pull camper" for three years, but stayed on a family friend's land to save money, per <a href=#>The Boot</a>. Although she struggled, Wilson was determined to land a record deal. "I was in Nashville for seven years before I was offered a publishing deal, but these moments keep me knowing I'm on the right track- that I'm not there yet but I'm going in the right direction," she told <a href=#>Forbes</a> in January 2021.</p><p dir=ltr>Wilson is enjoying success, having played at 2019's C2C festival and as an opener for Eric Paslay, per The Boot. She also toured with Morgan Wallen, Rodney Atkins, and Tyler Farr, among others. Wilson released her new album "Sayin' What I'm Thinkin'" in February 2021 (per <a href=#>People</a>) and is performing this summer. She's also joining <a href=#>Jason Aldean on his tour</a> and should make money from that as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWthaIN3e8eormalpZi1brXSZqOaoZ6axm7DyKWqqKZdrLyzwMdo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
