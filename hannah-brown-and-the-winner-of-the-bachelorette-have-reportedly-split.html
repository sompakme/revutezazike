You guys, this season of&nbsp;The Bachelorette&nbsp;has officially gone off the rails. Thanks to our trusty spoiler source Reality Steve, we now have some&nbsp;intense&nbsp;news from Hannah Brown and Jed Wyatt's "journey" of of love. First, the news of engagement on the show. Then, a broken engagement, because Jed didn't tell the truth&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a28089434/jed-wyatt-the-bachelorette-hannah-brown-after-show/>about the girls he was with before the show</a>. Now...and don't read any further if you really don't want to be spoiled:&nbsp;<strong>The couple have broken up for good</strong>.</p><p>Holy crap. Hannah! You poor thing! Here's everything we know, as we all prepare for what might be the most dramatic "After the Final Rose" of all time (rumored to be a two-parter on July 29th and 30th, so grab the popcorn and nab a spot on the couch).&nbsp;</p><h2 id=hannah-is-giving-us-big-hints-about-quot-after-the-final-rose-quot-drama-3>Hannah is giving us big hints about "After the Final Rose" drama.</h2><p><strong>Update, 7/30/19:&nbsp;</strong>As we brace for the second part of the two-part&nbsp;Bachelorette&nbsp;finale tonight including a likely epic "ATFR," Hannah has given us a little insight into just how awkward her interactions with Jed are about to be. We're going to see her final selection, Jed's proposal, and their breakup‚Äînot to mention, it's about to get Hannah Beast up in here, because Hannah told us last night she wants some questions answered:</p><p><strong>Since that last day in Greece, the past couple of months have been really tough and emotional. I know there are a lot of rumors out there, and honestly, tomorrow night, I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs gonna happen. But I have a lot of questions that need to be answered, so hope I‚Äôll be able to do that.</strong></p><p>Do NOT mess with Hannah, guys. Jed: Be forewarned, that interview is going to get ugly, because Hannah just put you on blast. ALSO, now that I'm reading into that quote way more than I should, what exactly does she mean by "I don't know what's gonna happen"? Was Jed still not honest with her? Is she about to call him on his behavior, which only came to light more recently? Or is she referring to interactions with her runner-up Tyler? I cannot wait.</p><p><strong>Original post, 7/22/19:</strong></p><h2 id=jed-told-hannah-about-his-ex-but-she-didn-apos-t-know-all-the-details-3>Jed told Hannah about his ex...but she didn't know all the details.</h2><p>According to Reality Steve, Jed&nbsp;did&nbsp;tell Hannah about his ex, Haley, but he absolutely phrased it as an "ex" situation. Also, per Reality Steve, this was apparently&nbsp;after&nbsp;the couple got engaged, so kinda sneaky on the timing, there, Jed. So: hey, I had an ex before the show, but we broke up, no biggie. And&nbsp;then&nbsp;the truth came out: They weren't broken up before the show, and she wasn't the only girl Jed was hooking up with, according to&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://people.com/tv/bachelorette-jed-wyatt-ex-says-he-ghosted-her/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Haley's exclusive with&nbsp;</a><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://people.com/tv/bachelorette-jed-wyatt-ex-says-he-ghosted-her/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>People</a>.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

I've said this before, but she's the person I feel the most sorry for in all of this.</p><h2 id=quot-after-the-final-rose-quot-is-going-to-dive-into-the-drama-3>"After the Final Rose" is going to dive into the drama.</h2><p>Chris Harrison&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=74968X1525081&xs=1&isjs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fchris-harrison-wants-to-push-jed-wyatt-on-his-girlfriend-scandal-during-bachelorette-finale-128721&xguid=&xuuid=54a854abacb644c4c97181a21038c724&xsessid=&xcreo=0&xed=0&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marieclaire.com%2Fcelebrity%2Fa27073091%2Fthe-bachelorette-hannah-brown-winner%2F&xtz=240&jv=3.21.7-stackpath&bv=2.5.1" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>explained</a>&nbsp;that he is going to "push" Jed for answers about his pre-show behavior on "After the Final Rose," and get his perspective on what happened with his now-ex-girlfriend Haley.

In other words, Jed's behavior crossed a line with her, and she won't tolerate that behavior no matter how he tries to justify it. My guess is that the producers got wind of the broken engagement news and absolutely asked/demanded to be a part of the final conversation, because...</p><h2 id=the-final-breakup-was-filmed-3>The final breakup was filmed.</h2><p>Yup. Apparently we're getting the footage during the second part of "After the Final Rose." That, and the "Men Tell All," is going to be absolutely bonkers. And I cannot wait to watch‚Äîafter all the crazy rumors about Jed, watching him face the music is going to be epic (second only to the conversation in which Hannah boots Luke off the show. This season has really brought the crazy guy drama).</p><h2 id=hannah-definitely-telegraphed-some-feelings-about-the-situation-3>Hannah definitely telegraphed some...feelings about the situation.</h2><p>Some&nbsp;intense&nbsp;feelings. Some breakup feelings‚Äîoh, you get it. Over the past couple days, we've gotten some very tangible hints that all is not perfect in Hannah's world.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Me then.

Hannah is MAD.</p><h2 id=will-hannah-get-back-together-with-tyler-cameron-3>Will Hannah get back together with Tyler Cameron?</h2><p>We could have a whole Arie situation on our hands‚Äîalthough, as Reality Steve is keen to point out, Arie just changed his mind. Hannah's been put in this crummy situation, not of her own volition but by a bachelor lying to her. We know Tyler came in a very close second, so now it really just depends on what he wants‚ÄîReality Steve has no news yet, but you can guarantee he's watching out for signs of spoilers. Is Tyler more interested in getting back together with Hannah, or&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a28115035/will-tyler-cameron-be-the-bachelor-2020/>would he rather be&nbsp;The Bachelor</a>? It's probably his to lose at this point, if he wants it. There's more drama to come, you guys, and it is going to be so, so watchable.</p><p>He hasn't addressed the news of his pre-show girlfriend, or that other girl he was maybe hooking up with, or the broken engagement, or the breakup (to be fair, he probably can't address the last two, contractually). But he did post on Instagram about his last aired date with Hannah with some, uh, pointed words in defense of Hannah.</p><p>"Hands down one of the best days I‚Äôve ever had," he writes. "Also, [Hannah] is the strongest in a lot of ways (especially arm wrestling). Let‚Äôs focus on that and spreading actual love." So this, on the surface, could be about&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a28115856/hannah-brown-instagram-the-bachelorette/>Hannah's response</a>&nbsp;to being attacked for speaking honestly about her physical relationships. But I wonder if that "spreading love" part also might pertain to him and some of the hate he's getting. As in, let's not spread hate to Hannah OR me and concentrate on other stuff. I doubt very much anyone's going to have any sympathy for him during "After the Final Rose," though.</p><p>Hannah did not like the post, even though she was tagged in it‚Äîwhich, you know, makes sense.</p><p>Jed later said he couldn't talk about anything in detail but he asked the abuse of him and his family to stop:</p><p>Obviously, attacks on a show contestant are not okay, regardless of how you feel about a person's behavior. I do still think, though, that the&nbsp;criticism&nbsp;of Jed is still warranted. I suspect he is going to get dragged, hard, in "After the Final Rose," unless he makes a full-on apology to everyone, including Hannah and Haley.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=hannah-gave-us-another-big-hint-about-the-post-show-drama-3>Hannah gave us another big hint about the post-show drama.</h2><p>She's been live-tweeting the episodes on Twitter, and when the Jed hometown date was being shown, she only had this to say:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>good toast. good message. cheers! üçª#TheBachlorette<a href=# data-url=https://twitter.com/hannahbrown/status/1148404684446679040 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>July 9, 2019</a></p><p>If you'll recall, Jed's mom made a toast: "When you stick to the truth, it‚Äôs beneficial to everyone!" Which has alllll kinds of layered meaning, given the above. If we read Hannah's tweet as sarcasm, and I think we can, this is just a tiny taste of what we can expect once she finally gets to sit down and tell her side of the story in all this. (Jed, meanwhile, stopped tweeting weeks ago.)</p><p>To be fair, Hannah also thanked the Wyatts and other families for opening their homes. I'm sort of sensing a theme here‚ÄîHannah's being very PC on Instagram, but she lets some of her real feelings show on Twitter.</p><p>The on-screen drama is going to be epic, you guys.</p><p>For more stories like this, including celebrity news, beauty and fashion advice, savvy political commentary, and fascinating features, sign up for the&nbsp;Marie Claire&nbsp;newsletter.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://link.marieclaire.com/join/3oa/mar-newsletter?authId=F0CC0C27-80DA-4734-ABDF-E4115B84A56B&maj=WNL&min=ARTICLES" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>SUBSCRIBE HERE</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRomGtwYmuEcn2RaJ%2Bapp6WtW6u0aiup2WamrFuw9iaq61lo6W5qsCMrZ%2BeZZKWsKmxy6ipnqykmnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
