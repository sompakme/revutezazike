The last season will have just ten episodes—most thus far have had at least 20—and will heavily feature longtime&nbsp;Criminal Minds&nbsp;stars Joe Mantegna, Matthew Gray Gubler, Kirsten Vangsness, Paget Brewster, and A.J. Cook, along with a handful of recent cast additions, as well as longtime guest star Jane Lynch.</p><p>Unlike its first 14 seasons, the final season began airing in CBS' mid-season slot rather than in the fall of 2019, as was initially expected. Here's what else we know about the last season of the show that made everyone in America double-check their doors were locked before they went to sleep (as any longtime viewer knows, the suburban family is the least safe of all!).</p><p>Oh, thank God. Lynch has played Reid's genius mom on and off since the very first season; her character, Diana, suffers from schizophrenia, and Reid had Diana committed when he became an adult. In season 12, Diana was kidnapped, and after she was saved by the BAU (because, of course), she and Reid had an emotional reunion. That's the last we saw of Diana—until now!</p><p>“I see a happy ending in store for Reid, which is something that we’re all looking forward to, including with his mom,”&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Criminal-Minds-Season-15-Details-46307291 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Gray Gubler told&nbsp;Parade.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a5Jxe7JGjieNYRs9He8qJf-1920-80.jpg><p>Said Messer&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.tvinsider.com/847489/criminal-minds-season-15-episode-4-preview/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>to TV Line:</a>&nbsp;"You see what our team does when they're not in the roundtable room getting briefed, getting on the jet and going to another city...If we had our way entirely, we wouldn't have had a crime to solve."</p><p>I mean, wouldn't you be?

Rossi "will be concluding the 10 episodes with a showdown with [the Chameleon]," said showrunner Erica Messer in a&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/criminal-minds-end-15th-final-season-cbs-canceled-renewed-1202532632/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>January interview with&nbsp;Deadline.</a></p><p>Daniel Henney&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/criminal-minds-watch-magazine-exclusive-season-15/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>told&nbsp;TV Line:&nbsp;</a>"Overall, I'd say [Season] 15 has more of an arc through the episodes than previous seasons.

In the same interview with&nbsp;Deadline, Messer teased that stars in the form of old un-subs and old cast members could return for a final goodbye.</p><p>She also mentioned that she'd be reluctant to kill off any of the most beloved and long-standing characters. "I know it’s a drama, but I’m less likely to injure or write someone off in a way that says they’re not breathing anymore," she said. (Full interview is&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/criminal-minds-end-15th-final-season-cbs-canceled-renewed-1202532632/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>here</a>.)</p><p>The cast members most in demand by fans would likely be Aaron "Hotch" Hotchner, played by Thomas Gibson; Derek Morgan, played by Shemar Moore; and Jason Gideon, played by Mandy Patinkin. For two of those three actors, coming back would be complicated—Gibson was abruptly fired from the show over anger-management issues (Gibson denies that he was violent, as the network claimed), and Patinkin has described his tenure on&nbsp;Criminal Minds&nbsp;as his "biggest public mistake," adding that the show "was very destructive to my soul and my personality" and suggesting that it&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://deadline.com/2012/09/mandy-patinkin-disses-cbs-criminal-minds-calls-it-his-biggest-public-mistake-336097/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>shouldn't have been made in the first place.</a></p><p>Shemar Moore is a different story. Moore has returned twice for guest spots and, plot-wise, showrunners left the door open for him to return in the future. It sure seems like he maintains a<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a29152842/shemar-moore-criminal-minds-season-15/>&nbsp;good relationship</a>&nbsp;with the show and its network—but he's also the lead on&nbsp;S.W.A.T.,&nbsp;which is currently airing, so scheduling conflicts may have arisen. (Ironically, until season 15,&nbsp;S.W.A.T.&nbsp;had replaced the Wednesday slot that&nbsp;Criminal Minds&nbsp;used to occupy. The audacity!)</p><p>Don't mind me, it's just some dust in my eye! I'm fine!!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5EMCCEhzf6HRipR9eVbp5g-1920-80.jpg><p>The final episode has already shot; the series wrapped up in May.</p><p>I wish that love interest were me, but it's not: Rachel Leigh Cook, who you might remember from&nbsp;She's All That&nbsp;and&nbsp;Josie and the Pussycats, guest stars as a&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://tvline.com/2019/02/20/criminal-minds-final-season-15-rachael-leigh-cook-reid-love-interest/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>love interest to Reid.</a>&nbsp;At the beginning of the season, we see JJ and Reid's friendship begin to recover from JJ's confession that she had been in love with him—and when it does, Leigh Cook arrives to steal Reid's heart.
