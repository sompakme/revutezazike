MARCA takes a closer look at the injuries that will have you looking away:</p><figure class="multimedia-item video" itemprop=video itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/VideoObject></figure><h3 class=list-header>Ewald Lienen's horrible injury</h3><p>During the Bundesliga clash between Werder Bremen and Arminia Bielefeld in the 1981/82 season, Ewald Lienen suffered a gash of 25 centimetres in his right thigh. It was one of the most gruesome images in football history with Lienen's reaction even more surprising as he instantly stood up and remonstrated with opposing coach Otto Rehhagel, who Lienen felt had instigated the foul.</p><figure class="multimedia-item video" itemprop=video itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/VideoObject></figure><h3 class=list-header>David Busst's 26 surgeries</h3><p>A horrendous clash with Denis Irwin and Brian McClair ended the career of Coventry City's David Busst at Old Trafford in 1996. Peter Schmeichel who was right near the incident was believed to be so distressed upon seeing the triple leg fracture that he was visibly sick on the pitch. Busst retired the same year and would receive a tribute match at Old Trafford. He was forced to have 26 operations to fully repair the damage.</p><figure class="multimedia-item video" itemprop=video itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/VideoObject></figure><h3 class=list-header>The worst moment of Ronaldo's career</h3><p>On April 12th 2000 Ronaldo made his return from a partially torn patellar tendon in his right knee. He had undergone surgery on 30th November 1999 and was all set to make his return as the best player in the world. A few minutes after entering the pitch his knee buckled and this time the tendon was completely torn. At just 23-years-old, Ronaldo's career was under threat.</p><figure class="multimedia-item video" itemprop=video itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/VideoObject></figure><h3 class=list-header>Manuel Pablo's broken tibia and fibula</h3><p>During Deportivo La Coruna and Celta Vigo's meeting at the end of 2001, Manuel Pablo suffered a fracture in his tibia and fibula. The injury came just a few months before the World Cup in Japan and South Korea, a tournament in which he was going to feature in for Spain.</p><figure class="multimedia-item video" itemprop=video itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/VideoObject></figure><h3 class=list-header>The reason Petr Cech always wears a helmet</h3><p>On October 14th 2006 Petr Cech suffered a horrific head injury in a match between Chelsea and Reading. A collision with Stephen Hunt's knee left the Czech goalkeeper with a severe skull fracture. Since that day he has had to wear a helmet in every single match. His manager at the time Jose Mourinho said this of this incident, "He is lucky to be alive."</p><figure class="multimedia-item video" itemprop=video itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/VideoObject></figure><h3 class=list-header>Eduardo breaks his leg</h3><p>The Croatian forward was at the height of his Arsenal career in the spring of 2008 as Arsenal challenged for the Premier League title. However an injury suffered courtesy of a Martin Taylor challenge ended his season and in truth his career in North London. Eduardo later said he didn't blame Taylor, "I want to believe what he said that what happened was an unfortunate accident, I would be amazed if what he did was premeditated."</p><figure class="multimedia-item video" itemprop=video itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/VideoObject></figure><h3 class=list-header>Puyol is made of sterner stuff</h3><p>Barcelona captain Puyol suffered a dislocated elbow on the pitch in Lisbon in 2012. The images of the injury were shocking and looked even worse than a simple dislocation, yet Puyol was not to be deterred and returned after just six weeks on the sidelines.</p><figure class="multimedia-item video" itemprop=video itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/VideoObject><i class=icon-caption-video></i> <span itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><span itemprop=name>youtube</span></span></figure><p><strong>Twitter: <a href=#>@MARCATV</a></strong></p><h4 class=list-header><span>Related tags</span></h4><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/e00-marca.uecdn.es/assets/v1/img/MARCA-SUSCRIBETE-660PX.png alt="SuscripciÃ³n a Marca" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jp%2BmqKySlrmte8inq56qnpbBqrvNmqNmnp%2BkwaOty6Vma2hha3xxgI5sZ2htZ2eAerGUn5xrb2BpsqOClW1vm2xlbX9vtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
