Not just because of his output and consistency but his business acumen that’s turned him into one of the most successful independent rap artists. From signing with Cash Money to later buying himself out of his own contract, he developed a cult-like following of fans who look to him for<a href=# rel> inspiration</a>, motivation, and gems on getting rich (i.e. <a href=# rel>$1M Bitcoin advance</a>).</p><p>Over the past few years, fans have grown accustomed to receiving numerous projects from Money Man. During the pandemic, he came through with back-to-back releases. He dropped Epidemic, followed it up with an extended version then blessed fans with<a href=# rel> State Of Emergency</a>. Even though each of the titles reflected the COVID state everyone was stuck in, Money Man brought motivational music to help people get through it. Last year, he blessed fans with two of his best project to date: Big Money and Blackout, as well as its extended version.</p><span><h2 id=h-money-man-taps-babyface-ray-peezy-for-red-eye>Money Man Taps Babyface Ray, Peezy For “Red Eye”</h2></span><p>Though he kept lowkey since the top of 2023, Money Man came through with a statement with his latest project, Red Eye. The rapper’s new project consists of fourteen songs in total with a select few features, largely from Detroit counterparts. Babyface Ray helps kick the project off on Money Man's “Drums,” which led to the album’s release. Then, Peezy comes through with an impressive verse for “Latest Gen.” Additionally, Juney Knotzz appears on “<a href=# class=text-word rel>Atmosphere</a>.”</p><p>The production of the project also helps showcase Money Man’s versatility. Though his muddy trap efforts helped build his empire, his latest project finds him exploring different genres. Perhaps, that’s as evident as the collaborations on the project. Blameswagg holds down the majority of the production on Red Eye. However, Money Man also connects with CorMill, Alawais, ProdTao, Flexotb, Oj beatz, Cubeatz, and more to flesh out his latest project.
