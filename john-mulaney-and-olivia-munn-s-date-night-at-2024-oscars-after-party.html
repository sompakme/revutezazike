Her hair was parted in the middle and pulled back off her face, and she carried what appeared to be a rose gold-tinted bejeweled clutch to accompany her simple but sparkling look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though the couple’s controversial <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>whirlwind romance</a> began in 2021, they’ve actually known each other since 2013, when they met at Seth Meyers’ wedding to Alexi Ashe.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2020, Munn tweeted a message of support when the news dropped that Mulaney would be entering a rehab facility for addiction. He was married to artist Anna Marie Tendler at the time.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In June 2021, Mulaney was spotted with Munn — less than two months after separating from Tendler.&nbsp;"I am heartbroken that John has decided to end our marriage," Tendler&nbsp;told Page Six at that time. "I wish him support and success as he continues his recovery."&nbsp;(Mulaney divorced Tendler in July.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The press went wild with speculation on their relationship timeline, and the rumor mill popped off even more when Mulaney announced that he and Munn were expecting a baby on Seth Meyers’s show in September 2021 — just months after the new couple reportedly started dating.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm gonna be a dad ... we're both really, really happy," Mulaney told Meyers when he first publicly disclosed the pregnancy. “I was nervous when I was about to say the news! Olivia and this baby have helped save me from myself in this early journey out of recovery [from my drug addiction]."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Munn gave birth to their son, Malcolm,&nbsp;in November 2021, and the trio have appeared to be a happy family ever since.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Tendler has since <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>penned a memoir</a>, Men Have Called Her Crazy, which will be released in August.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yaifp2WdqrmiusSyZKikmau2onnMrqWnZZ%2BosKK%2B0mZpaWpkYoV3fJZraWk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
