News alert! Yes, your lips can be sunburned too.</p><p>Yep, burnt lips are a very real thing. In fact, your mouth is even more prone to <a href=#>sunburn</a> than other areas of your body because of the unique and sensitive nature of the skin on your lips. “[The lips] have a thinner layer of skin compared to the rest of the skin on the body, and very little melanin, which helps provide some natural protection from UV rays,” says Birmingham, Alabama-based board dermatologist <a data-offer-url="https://www.instagram.com/dr.coreyhartman/?hl=en" class=external-link data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/dr.coreyhartman/?hl=en"}' href=# rel=noopener>Corey L.

How a sunburn presents itself, of course, depends on the level of damage inflicted.</p><p>Symptoms of a mild case can include <a href=#>dryness</a>, irritation, and redness. If your lips fit that description 24/7, first of all, may we suggest a few of our favourite hydrators? And second, ask yourself if you feel heat radiating from your lips, which is a telltale sign of sunburn, says Dr. Hartman. If you're suffering from a moderate to serious burn, those symptoms kick into overdrive in the form of blisters, bleeding, pain, and extreme <a href=#>sensitivity</a>.</p><p>As with any sunburn, you're going to be dealing with the immediate consequences for anywhere from three to five days. And the state of your lips might get worse before it gets better: “When the lip heals, the dead skin peels off and sheds,” says Dr. Saedi, noting that it's normal (and, in fact, a sign of healing) to also experience some itchiness during the process.</p><h2><strong>What does sun damage on lips look like on dark skin?</strong></h2><p>Sun damage on dark skin manifests a little differently than it does on light skin. The natural lip colour is more likely to vary, as dark skin often means having dual tones in either on one of both top and bottom lips. Dr. Ejikeme says: “On dark skin, sun damage may appear as dark spots, uneven pigmentation, or discolouration on the lips. Lips might also become dry, chapped, and develop a rough texture.”</p><p>When it comes to discolouration, sun damage can cause the lips to develop a darker and uneven hue in the middle of the lips. As for the rougher texture, this can also manifest as wrinkles and fine lines on the lips, particularly around the edges. This can also make lips loose definition and appear less plump with a more flattened appearance.</p><p>“It's essential to note that sun damage can affect individuals of all skin tones, so protecting the lips from the sun's harmful rays is crucial for everyone.” Dr. Ejikeme adds.</p><h2><strong>Can sunburned lips cause cold sores and blisters?</strong></h2><p>But notice we said those symptoms are the immediate consequences — because unfortunately, a sunburn on your lips can sometimes cause more trouble down the line.</p><p>“The heat and the stress to the skin of a sunburn can lead to the development of cold sores,” says Dr. Saedi. Cold sores, of course, are not to be confused with the aforementioned blisters that result from sunburn in and of itself. “The blisters [associated with] cold sores are different in that they are usually clustered together and painful,” according to Dr. Saedi.</p><p>Sun damage on the lips can also result in lingering discolouration in the form of <a href=#>hyperpigmentation</a>. But far more disturbingly, “a bad sunburn on the lips, just like on other parts of your body, can lead to an increased risk for <a href=#>skin cancer</a>,” says Dr. Hartman. “I do see patients with skin cancerous growths on the lips, including melanoma, which is the deadliest form.”</p><h2><strong>Can sunburned lips cause hyperpigmentation?</strong></h2><p>Sunburned lips can potentially cause hyperpigmentation. Dr. Ejikeme says: “When the lips are exposed to excessive sun exposure and become sunburned, the skin cells can produce excess melanin, leading to darkening or hyperpigmentation.” Hyperpigmentation on the lips may appear as dark patches or spots, and sometimes they can take some time to fade, so prevention is better over cure. “It's essential to protect your lips from the sun and apply SPF lip balm regularly to prevent sunburn and minimise the risk of hyperpigmentation.” She adds.</p><h2><strong>How do you treat sunburned lips?</strong></h2><p>That said, if you notice an unusual spot on your lips or a sore that won't heal, visit a dermatologist as soon as you can. But to treat the symptoms of lip sunburn in the short term, there are a few steps you can take from the comfort of home.</p><p>"If you find yourself with a mild sunburn, you can use a cool compress on your lips to alleviate some of the swelling and bring down the heat in your lips," says Dr. Hartman. This trick works nicely when used in conjunction with an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication, which helps relieve mild pain.</p><p>Applying <a href=#>aloe vera</a> gel to the lips can also help ease irritation. (Dr. Saedi suggests chilling it first to maximize the soothing benefits.) On the flip side, at this stage it's best to avoid any lip products with petrolatum, like Vaseline. "Those will actually seal in the heat and prolong the burn and any painful symptoms," Dr. Hartman says.</p><a tabindex=-1 aria-hidden=true data-offer-retailer=Sephora data-offer-url=https://www.sephora.co.uk/p/La-Roche-Posay-Anthelios-XL-SPF50-Stick-9g class="external-link BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ BaseLink-eNWuiM ProductEmbedImageLink-dHxNy iUEiRd fwrdgh cuqOKN bgZAlB" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://cna.st/p/2h8zKZvUAqv9bS4J2o5bBdfPPohW5ZiCEsVte3ZEjQF3qZypCYwGHXiVZihCPEY53BddJ1DtLFemKdTTqbNS6iqbGnk4xdYMAQr8hwdBbswENfbqFMwfE9Lx4dtS7RbUE66eqaJ3psbjatukD1wfymiPAadQnSJi5mXFquG6VpzioyqbPk"}' href=# rel="sponsored noopener"><span class="SpanWrapper-umhxW jvZaPI responsive-asset ProductEmbedImage-cIdULW iluLcW"></span></a>La Roche-Posay Anthelios XL SPF50+ Stick<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener" aria-describedby=646799e859411ece0418484d aria-label="£12.50 at Sephora" data-buy-button=true data-offer-retailer=Sephora data-offer-url=https://www.sephora.co.uk/p/La-Roche-Posay-Anthelios-XL-SPF50-Stick-9g class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ bXyBUt bAIxFC button button--primary-pair product-offer__buy-button" data-event-click='{"element":"Button","outgoingURL":"https://cna.st/p/2h8zKZvUAqv9bS4J2o5bBdfPPohW5ZiCEsVte3ZEjQF3qZypCYwGHXiVZihCPEY53BddJ1DtLFemKdTTqbNS6iqbGnk4xdYMAQr8hwdBbswENfbqFMwfE9Lx4dtS7RbUE66eqaJ3psbjatukD1wfymiPAadQnSJi5mXFquG6VpzioyqbPk"}' data-testid=Button type><span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN hzwRuG button__label"><span>£12.50</span> at Sephora</span></a><a tabindex=-1 aria-hidden=true data-offer-retailer="Beauty Bay" data-offer-url=https://www.beautybay.com/p/ultrasun/lip-protection-spf50/ class="external-link BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ BaseLink-eNWuiM ProductEmbedImageLink-dHxNy iUEiRd fwrdgh cuqOKN bgZAlB" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://cna.st/p/2h8zKZvUAqv9bS4J2o5bBdfPPohW5ZiCEsVte3ZEjQF3qZypCYwGHXibrnDsHBJKm5nDR7Pns4fzaJFJycexke8ZY7XutwPAw96kt3zfchwCHGd7Jg8Brhyn7ReWfbqLDSMa7EDoWasLcJxA2xVtfYWer1jzZhXXbp9qyPNrnGHXhUfD8A"}' href=# rel="sponsored noopener"><span class="SpanWrapper-umhxW jvZaPI responsive-asset ProductEmbedImage-cIdULW iluLcW"></span></a>Ultrasun Lip Protection SPF50<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener" aria-describedby=6467a9d359411ece0418486c aria-label="£10 at Beauty Bay" data-buy-button=true data-offer-retailer="Beauty Bay" data-offer-url=https://www.beautybay.com/p/ultrasun/lip-protection-spf50/ class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ bXyBUt bAIxFC button button--primary-pair product-offer__buy-button" data-event-click='{"element":"Button","outgoingURL":"https://cna.st/p/2h8zKZvUAqv9bS4J2o5bBdfPPohW5ZiCEsVte3ZEjQF3qZypCYwGHXibrnDsHBJKm5nDR7Pns4fzaJFJycexke8ZY7XutwPAw96kt3zfchwCHGd7Jg8Brhyn7ReWfbqLDSMa7EDoWasLcJxA2xVtfYWer1jzZhXXbp9qyPNrnGHXhUfD8A"}' data-testid=Button type><span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN hzwRuG button__label"><span>£10</span> at Beauty Bay</span></a><h2><strong>Can you prevent sunburned lips?</strong></h2><p>Now, here's the good news: sunburn on your lips is totally avoidable if you're diligent about applying SPF. While Dr. Hartman says you can apply your favourite facial sunscreen over your lips for some protection, using a lip balm with <a href=#>SPF 30</a> or higher is ideal.</p><p>“Apply it at least 15 minutes before you go outside and reapply after swimming, sweating, or eating and drinking, since [that] can take off your SPF lip balm just like it can your lipstick,” says Dr. Hartman.</p><p>And with a new wave of non-chalky, comfortable-to-wear options now on the market (Dr. Saedi likes <a data-offer-url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/SUN-BUM-Sunscreen-30-15oz-Watermelon/dp/B072QXB8KX class=external-link data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/EKxjmNPJfxzR7jo19ujFPnjhfpuF33M2jetwDErvQvG3LCc2bfRLAZHcSfipFfRkoNLyiXXgAgAgumz1pu9UN2J5JTSx6gWZ5ahhPpQth8pb2uR6jYXh1Z99Dod4mCec6cZyjbDwCcb551?cid=62545233b44efee8c7151284"}' href=# rel=sponsored>Sun Bum Mineral SPF 30 Sunscreen Lip Balm</a>), you might find yourself applying SPF lip balm even more often than you ‘need’ to. And that's not lip service.</p><p>“Opt for fragrance-free and hypoallergenic products that provide moisture and nourishment to the skin. Additionally, drink plenty of water to stay hydrated and aid in the healing process.” Adds Dr. Ejikeme.</p><a tabindex=-1 aria-hidden=true data-offer-retailer="Beauty Bay" data-offer-url=https://www.beautybay.com/p/sun-bum/original-spf-30-sunscreen-lip-balm/pomegranate/ class="external-link BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ BaseLink-eNWuiM ProductEmbedImageLink-dHxNy iUEiRd fwrdgh cuqOKN bgZAlB" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://cna.st/p/2h8zKZvUAqv9bS4J2o5bBdfPPohW5ZiCEsVte3ZEjQF3qZypCYwGHXiccjsjxGfJmpdXJHhLJ68h4SRaeZq1RuJd9EfURG4UrY9TtST3MU2VD9ND2qVqEpVmM459Wh9Ay2riQE65mSH1z35BzV9eFBbg7MCsg4zvxZiHvsrCHwM3fMs9qY"}' href=# rel="sponsored noopener"><span class="SpanWrapper-umhxW jvZaPI responsive-asset ProductEmbedImage-cIdULW iluLcW"></span></a>Sun Bum Original SPF30 Sunscreen Lip Balm<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener" aria-describedby=6467adec59411ece04184871 aria-label="£4.95 at Beauty Bay" data-buy-button=true data-offer-retailer="Beauty Bay" data-offer-url=https://www.beautybay.com/p/sun-bum/original-spf-30-sunscreen-lip-balm/pomegranate/ class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ bXyBUt bAIxFC button button--primary-pair product-offer__buy-button" data-event-click='{"element":"Button","outgoingURL":"https://cna.st/p/2h8zKZvUAqv9bS4J2o5bBdfPPohW5ZiCEsVte3ZEjQF3qZypCYwGHXiccjsjxGfJmpdXJHhLJ68h4SRaeZq1RuJd9EfURG4UrY9TtST3MU2VD9ND2qVqEpVmM459Wh9Ay2riQE65mSH1z35BzV9eFBbg7MCsg4zvxZiHvsrCHwM3fMs9qY"}' data-testid=Button type><span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN hzwRuG button__label"><span>£4.95</span> at Beauty Bay</span></a><a tabindex=-1 aria-hidden=true data-offer-retailer=Net-A-Porter data-offer-url=https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-gb/shop/product/ultra-violette/beauty/lip-balm/sheen-screen-spf50-hydrating-lip-balm-dusk-15g/16114163150911160 class="external-link BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ BaseLink-eNWuiM ProductEmbedImageLink-dHxNy iUEiRd fwrdgh cuqOKN bgZAlB" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://cna.st/p/2h8zKZvUAqv9bS4J2o5bBdfPPohW5ZiCEsVte3ZEjQF3qZypCYwGHXiceNx2zmyrZertQa8TJhVQ7co5Hwu8kcfePCExSGNve8HFUYjNW5CdtHNwDP4zmBLtQAjR3qmZtgZreVdNtFDGnSEfRD94DKf52LuEN7U5okSYjD7zW2o7fd2qY2"}' href=# rel="sponsored noopener"><span class="SpanWrapper-umhxW jvZaPI responsive-asset ProductEmbedImage-cIdULW iluLcW"></span></a>Ultra Violette Sheen Screen SPF50 Hydrating Lip Balm<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener" aria-describedby=6467af9e27a9884ab8cf733d aria-label="£16 at Net-A-Porter" data-buy-button=true data-offer-retailer=Net-A-Porter data-offer-url=https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-gb/shop/product/ultra-violette/beauty/lip-balm/sheen-screen-spf50-hydrating-lip-balm-dusk-15g/16114163150911160 class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ bXyBUt bAIxFC button button--primary-pair product-offer__buy-button" data-event-click='{"element":"Button","outgoingURL":"https://cna.st/p/2h8zKZvUAqv9bS4J2o5bBdfPPohW5ZiCEsVte3ZEjQF3qZypCYwGHXiceNx2zmyrZertQa8TJhVQ7co5Hwu8kcfePCExSGNve8HFUYjNW5CdtHNwDP4zmBLtQAjR3qmZtgZreVdNtFDGnSEfRD94DKf52LuEN7U5okSYjD7zW2o7fd2qY2"}' data-testid=Button type><span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN hzwRuG button__label"><span>£16</span> at Net-A-Porter</span></a><h2><strong>What to avoid on sunburned lips?</strong></h2><p>Other ways to prevent sunburn lips is to avoid picking or peeling the skin. Dr. Ejikeme also advices refraining from licking your lips. “Saliva can further dry out your lips and worsen the sunburn.” During the healing process, it's also best to avoid using harsh or fragranced lip products, specially ones that tingle. These include but are not limited to lipsticks, lip stains, or lip plumpers. “These can irritate the sensitive skin and prolong the healing time.” Dr. Ejikeme adds.</p><p>When it comes to exfoliation, it best to avoid it on sunburned lips. “While exfoliation can be beneficial for removing dead skin cells, it's not recommended for sunburned lips. Exfoliating can be too harsh on the damaged skin, causing further irritation.” Dr. Ejikeme explains.</p><p>Find out all about the best tried-and-tested <a href=#>SPF for lips</a>, as well as the <a href=#>best face sunscreens</a> you'll want to wear all year round.</p><a data-testid=contentPromoEmbedWrapper href=# class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ BaseLink-eNWuiM ContentPromoEmbedWrapper-wTiLP iUEiRd fwrdgh cuqOKN gvjunS"><span class="SpanWrapper-umhxW jvZaPI responsive-asset ContentPromoEmbedResponsiveAsset-zzLFw hbwssY"></span>These are the best lip balms with SPF (because your lips need protection, too)<span class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ ItemsCountIcon-STnPz iUEiRd cMejiB dunaGh items-count__icon gallery">Gallery</span><span class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ ItemsCountContent-gIwYBd iUEiRd jeVEzI gNNffg items-count__content">9 Photos</span><p class="BylineWrapper-jWHrLH eTMkhU byline bylines__byline" data-testid=BylineWrapper itemprop=author itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><span itemprop=name class="BylineNamesWrapper-jbHncj fuDQVo"><span data-testid=BylineName class="BylineName-kwmrLn bGDGPP byline__name"><span class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ BylinePreamble-iJolpQ iUEiRd cBpqA-D hfYXYU byline__preamble">By </span>Lottie Winter</span></span></p><span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN hzwRuG button__label">View Gallery</span></a><p>This story originally appeared on <a href=#>Allure.com</a> and has been updated by Glamour.co.uk</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjApqauqp2WtKLGyKecZ5ufY8Kse8Crq6KbnJp8tMHNm6yrpl2ku264yKmq</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
