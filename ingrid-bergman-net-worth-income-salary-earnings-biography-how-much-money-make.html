She received three Academy Awards, two Emmy Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, and the Tony Award for Best Actress for her performances. In a poll conducted by the American Film Institute, she was named as the fourth greatest female star in American movie history. Most notably, she is renowned for her appearances as Ilsa Lund in Casablanca (1942), a World War II drama in which she appeared with Humphrey Bogart, and as Alicia Huberman in Notorious (1946), an Alfred Hitchcock thriller in which she appeared alongside Cary Grant.&nbsp; She had previously worked as a prominent actress in Swedish films before breaking out as a star in American cinema. After appearing as the lead in the English-language version of the Italian film Intermezzo in 1939, she became well-known in the United States. With her “Nordic freshness and vitality” on the screen, as well as her exceptional beauty and intelligence, she quickly established herself as “the ideal of American womanhood” and one of Hollywood’s greatest leading actresses, according to the St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture (St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture).&nbsp; Following her performance in Victor Fleming’s adaptation of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in 1941, she caught the attention of her future producer David O. Selznick, who described her as “the most thoroughly conscientious actor” he had ever had the pleasure of working with. In response to her demand, he began with a one-film part and, after that, signed a four-film deal (also at her insistence) rather of the customary seven-year acting contracts generally negotiated with international performers at the time, therefore ensuring her continuous popularity.&nbsp; In addition to Casablanca, she appeared in a number of other films, including For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), Gaslight (1944), The Bells of St. Mary’s (1945), Alfred Hitchcock’s Spellbound (1945), Notorious (1946), and Under Capricorn (1949), as well as the independent movie Joan of Arc (1948). Having achieved success in American films for a decade by 1950, she featured in the Italian film Stromboli. The picture, which she acted in, resulted in a love affair with director Roberto Rossellini, who was married at the time. The controversy surrounding her romance and subsequent marriage to Rossellini caused her to stay in Europe until 1956, when she made a spectacular Hollywood comeback with Anastasia, for which she received her second Academy Award and the forgiveness of her admirers. She has a large collection of personal and film documentation, which may be found at the Wesleyan University Cinema Archives.<h2>Ingrid Bergman Net Worth : $ 20 Million</h2><p>Lets check out updated 2021 Ingrid Bergman Net Worth Income Salary report which is given below :</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><b>Ingrid Bergman’s Salary /&nbsp;</b></span><b>Income</b><b>:</b><p><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><br></span><span><b>Per Year:</b>&nbsp;$ 4,00,000</span></span><br><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><br></span><span><b>Per Month:</b>&nbsp;$ 32,000</span></span><br><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><br></span><span><b>Per Week:</b>&nbsp;$ 8,000</span></span><br><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><br></span></span></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Day:</span></b></td><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Hour:</span></b></td><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Minute:</span></b></td><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Second:</span></b></td></tr><tr><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 1140</span></td><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 19</span></td><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 0.3</span></td><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 0.05</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Ingrid Bergman Wiki</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$20 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>1915-08-29</td></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>1982-08-29</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Stockholm, Sweden</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Producer</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Petter Lindström, Roberto Rossellini</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Isotta Ingrid Rossellini, Robertino Rossellini, Robertino Rossellini,, Roberto Ingmar Rossellini,, * Pia Lindström, * Roberto Ingmar Rossellini, * Isabella Rossellini, * Isotta Ingrid Rossellini</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Justus Samuel Bergman, Frieda Henrietta Adler Bergman, Ingrid’s Age: 13, Ingrid’s Age: 2, Frieda Adler, Ingrid’s age: 13, Ingrid’s age: 2, Justus Bergman, * Frieda Adler , * Justus Bergman</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">http://imdb.com/name/nm5067525</a></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Ingrid Bergman FAQ</h2><ul><li>How did Ingrid Bergman get so rich?</li><li>What is Ingrid Bergman Earning per day ?</li><li>Lets check out Ingrid Bergman Wife / Husand Net Worth ?</li><li>How much does Ingrid Bergman make per day?</li><li>How much Ingrid Bergman Net Worth ?</li><li>How Ingrid Bergman become rich ?</li><li>How does Ingrid Bergman make money ?</li><li>What is Ingrid Bergman Income ?</li><li>How much Ingrid Bergman Salary ?</li><li>How old is Ingrid Bergman Age ?</li><li>How tall is Ingrid Bergman Height ?</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZnxxhI6ipaCqmZl6o7HRoKSapl2jsrV51qipraBdnruku8yeZKyZnJa%2FunnEmqmnoZ6cwG6uyKieq5mgncZutM6wZKatk516rrvNnrBmpZGgsm%2B006aj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
