Oh, that's fantastic," Kohls told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. "That's phenomenal. I love it."</p><p>Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and president of Los Angeles-based West Coast Trial Lawyers, said that while perhaps inadvisable, Kohrs did not violate state laws by discussing the special grand jury report as revealing its deliberations.</p><p>It is also Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, not the special grand jury, who will ultimately decide on whether to bring forward any charges in the investigation.</p><p>"Kohrs' media tour isn't helpful, and feeds into Trump's argument that the grand jury investigation is a political witch hunt by a Democratic district attorney and the left-leaning mainstream news media," Rahmani told Newsweek.</p><p>"But setting aside the bad optics, it won't have much of a legal effect on a potential indictment. The special grand jury could only investigate and make recommendations on what charges to bring. Willis can indict Trump or others because of, or in spite of, Kohrs and her fellow grand jurors' recommendations," he said.</p><p>Kohrs has been widely condemned for giving such <a href=# rel=noopener class=multivariate>extensive media interviews</a> about the ongoing case.</p><p>Former <a href=# data-sys=1 class=multivariate>Department of Justice</a> inspector general Michael Bromwich described Kohrs as a "reckless idiot" on <a href=# data-sys=1 class=multivariate>Twitter</a> amid reports that a number of Republican witnesses in Fulton County are preparing to move to quash any possible indictments because of her public statements during the ongoing criminal investigation.</p><p>Frank Figliuzzi, a former <a href=# data-sys=1 class=multivariate>FBI</a> assistant director for counterintelligence, told <a href=# data-sys=1 class=multivariate>MSNBC</a> that he had never seen a grand juror of any kind, special or otherwise, "come out and speak like this" in his 25-year career.</p><p>"I am deeply troubled by the fact that this much disclosure is going on in this process, and I think it has legal ramifications," Figliuzzi said.</p><figure class="block block-ibtg-article fA" data-gtm-category="Related In-Text A" data-gtm-action=Click></figure><p>Unsurprisingly, <a href=# rel=noopener class=multivariate>Trump himself also criticized Kohrs</a> for her media appearances while describing the Georgia investigation as a "strictly political continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt of all time" and accusing Willis, who is Black, of being "racist."</p><p>"Now you have an extremely energetic young woman, the (get this!) 'foreperson' of the Racist D.A.'s Special Grand Jury, going around and doing a Media Tour revealing, incredibly, the Grand Jury's inner workings & thoughts," Trump wrote on social media.</p><p>"This is not JUSTICE, this is an illegal Kangaroo Court."</p><p>In a series of tweets, MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin defended Kohrs, though said the quotes she gave were reminiscent of "an overconfident gymnast on a balance beam."</p><p>"One somersault or even an errant step away from a big tumble that could hurt the process. Fortunately, she stayed on," Rubin wrote.</p><p>"For all the talking she did, she didn't say much. Yes, we now know Meadows testified and invoked privilege often. Yes, she confirmed they recommended indictments of more than a dozen people. Yes, she was flabbergasted & amused when told of Trump's claim of 'total exoneration,'" Rubin added.</p><p>"But did she reveal deliberations about specific charges or people? At worst, she explained why the special grand jury declined to call Trump for testimony.</p><p>"I'm not saying a future defendant won't make a motion of some kind based on her media tour. But given that GA special grand juries are investigative, not charging, bodies & that GA law, unlike federal law, favors public disclosure of grand jury proceedings, it'll likely fail."</p><span><i class=uncommon-logo></i></span><h2>Uncommon Knowledge</h2><p class=subtitle-desktop>Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.</p><p class=subtitle-mobile>Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.</p><p>");jQuery(this).remove()}) jQuery('.start-slider').owlCarousel({loop:!1,margin:10,nav:!0,items:1}).on('changed.owl.carousel',function(event){var currentItem=event.item.index;var totalItems=event.item.count;if(currentItem===0){jQuery('.owl-prev').addClass('disabled')}else{jQuery('.owl-prev').removeClass('disabled')} if(currentItem===totalItems-1){jQuery('.owl-next').addClass('disabled')}else{jQuery('.owl-next').removeClass('disabled')}})}})})</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrK6enZtjsLC5jp6koqSpYriwtNGsZKGZoqKypXnTq6ymqF2euqKzxGaqqZ2Tnq6tecarmKecXZ%2FCs8WMoJyoqpeerm59lnFqbGti</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
