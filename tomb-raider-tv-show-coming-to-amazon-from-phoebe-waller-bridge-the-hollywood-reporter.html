The project, which is in the development stages, is the latest to stem from Waller-Bridge’s <a href=#>recently renewed overall deal</a> with the retail giant and streamer.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that Waller-Bridge is attached to write the scripts for Tomb Raider. Waller-Bridge does not plan to star in the TV adaptation of the property, which spawned 2001 and 2018 film adaptations starring Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander, respectively, as the adventurous archaeologist. The Lara Croft character was also voiced by actresses including Camilla Luddington, Keeley Hawes and Minnie Driver in a slew of video game titles. Hayley Atwell also brought the character to life in a Netflix anime series.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In addition to writing, Waller-Bridge will exec produce the Amazon take alongside former head of comedy and drama Ryan Andolina and former head of overall deals Amanda Greenblatt. Andolina and Greenblatt launched their own production company and have a deal with Amazon. Dmitri M. Johnson will also exec produce via his dj2 company.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Amazon did not immediately respond to THR’s requests for comment.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Tomb Raider becomes the latest project in the works for Waller-Bridge at Amazon. The actress-writer-producer is also developing <a href=#>Sign Here</a>, an adaptation of Claudia Lux’s book, with the author attached to write the script. &nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Jennifer Salke-led platform announced last March that it had&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>greenlit a series from Waller-Bridge</a>&nbsp;but declined to provide details, including whether it was a comedy or drama. Sources note Tomb Raider is not that project. Production on that mystery series was scheduled to begin last year; it’s unclear if it remains on schedule.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Waller-Bridge was previously attached to star opposite Donald Glover in a TV series version of Brad Pitt and Jolie’s action thriller&nbsp;Mr. & Mrs. Smith,&nbsp;but the actress&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>departed</a>&nbsp;the show after her vision for the project differed from the&nbsp;Atlanta&nbsp;alum’s approach. (The duo, who both appeared in&nbsp;Solo: A Star Wars Story,&nbsp;remain friendly following the amicable split.)</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Waller-Bridge has remained in high demand following the breakout success of Amazon’s&nbsp;Fleabag. With her initial three-year deal nearing its expiration late last year, sources note Amazon was aggressive in approaching her about renewing the pact. Waller-Bridge next stars opposite Harrison Ford in&nbsp;Indiana Jones 5&nbsp;and co-wrote the James Bond feature&nbsp;No Time to Die.&nbsp;Her TV credits also include HBO’s&nbsp;Run.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Waller-Bridge is repped by UTA, Hatton McEwan Penford, Independent Talent Group and Johnson Shapiro.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Additional reporting by Kim Masters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOraamml2nrqqwxKtkra5dqLWww4yapJqyn6N6sbTOnpmeZaeWua2x0WaZq6GUnLJufZFsbGxpYWqFc3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
