The piece of blue fabric that's stitched inside? It's my something blue. It's fabric from the dress I wore on our first date."</p><p id=enMigETi3SH data-wc=44>Designer Clare Waight Keller corroborated the story about Meghan's 'something blue', telling<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;Vanity Fair</a>: "We basically sewed it into the hem of the wedding dress, so she was the only one that knew that it was there. It was a little blue gingham check."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d45985085125-meghan-markle-wedding-bouquet.jpg><p id=eshzi53dARZ data-wc=72>So was Meghan wearing casual jeans and a jumper or a pretty blue gingham check dress? It's possible that they were both correct, since Meghan only spent one hour at Soho House for their official first date, before heading to dinner with a friend. She reportedly became "so forward and American" and called the royal that evening to ask him to dinner the following night so they could spend more time together.</p><p id=eDmRyRXLNSj data-wc=64>At the time, the roles were reversed and it was Meghan who pitched up late to the meeting. Teasing his wife about being "quite flustered," she replied: "I hate being late. Well, I had come back from Wimbledon and, you know, when you get all dolled up I wanted to go home and take a shower and then run over looking more like myself."</p><p id=eP8pD8BjHwb data-wc=48>A photo shared as part of their Netflix docuseries, Harry & Meghan, showed the pair cuddling up for a selfie with Meghan wearing a sleeveless outfit. So it's possible this was the first date dress (which was technically their second date) she was referring to following their wedding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9edb149d49fd-prince-harry-meghan-markle-kensington-palace.jpg><p id=eEr1k2Y6bqA data-wc=40>Prince Harry proposed in the garden of their former home, Nottingham Cottage at Kensington Palace, in 2017.
