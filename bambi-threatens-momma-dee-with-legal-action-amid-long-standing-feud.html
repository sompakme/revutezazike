Discussing their issues with Amanda Seales on her Small Doses podcast, the Love And Hip Hop Atlanta star revealed her intentions for court.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The conversation arose while Bambi was discussing how she too often lets things go. “I just started to realize this year. People are like, ‘You let stuff go so much.’ I think if I just keep going and don’t have to deal with it, I just be like whatever, whatever. I don’t get offended by much and that’s not a good thing.” From there, Seales asked her age, noting that the mentality may catch up with her.</p><span></span><p>ATLANTA, GEORGIA - FEBRUARY 09: Rapper Lil Scrappy and Adiz 'Bambi' Benson attend New York Knicks vs Atlanta Hawks game at State Farm Arena on February 09, 2020 in Atlanta, Georgia.

Okay…my mother-in-law, right? I’m suing her for defamation of character because she just literally said two days ago that I used a fake ID when I went to jail and gave them the wrong age, and she’s just making a big thing out of…so let’s just…I know that’s a lot to…” Seales then remarked, “I just…can’t we all get along?" to which Bambi admitted, "No, we cannot, ma’am. We are suing people.”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-bambi-reveals-plan-to-sue-momma-dee>Bambi Reveals Plan To Sue Momma Dee</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The lawsuit comes after Bambi was arrested along with Erica Mena and Zell Swag for an incident at a club, last month.
