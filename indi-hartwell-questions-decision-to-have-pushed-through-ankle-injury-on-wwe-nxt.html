She finally reached the top of the mountain by winning the NXT Women’s Championship last year but ultimately relinquished it. Now, Hartwell admitted she shouldn’t have pushed herself through the injury.</p><p>Indi Hartwell entered her match at NXT Spring Breakin’ as the NXT Women’s Champion, facing Tiffany Stratton and Roxanne Perez. Despite retaining her title, she sustained an ankle injury during the match. One week later, <a href=#>Hartwell relinquished the NXT Women’s Championship due to the injury</a>.</p><p>Hartwell gave an emotional speech to her fans and made it clear she will always be grateful to them. She was then picked up by Dexter Lumis as Hartwell made her way to the back.</p><p>While speaking on&nbsp;<a href=#>West Sport</a>, Hartwell reflected on the injury and fighting through the pain. Hartwell expressed uncertainty about the choice to continue but acknowledged that in the moment, she was determined to return to the match. Despite the pain, she pleaded with coaches, producers, and the medical team to allow her back into the match, believing she could tough it out.</p><p>“Looking back, I don’t know if I should have done that. In the moment, I was like, ‘I have to go back out there.’ I was begging the coaches and producers and the medical team to let me go back out there. Yeah, it bloody hurt. I thought, how much worse can it get? I did it.”&nbsp;</p><p>Indi Hartwell holds the record for the shortest NXT Women’s Championship reign to date, lasting just 31 days. She is currently part of WWE Raw and has reunited with Candice LeRae and is more than happy there.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your view on what Indi Hartwell had to say?
