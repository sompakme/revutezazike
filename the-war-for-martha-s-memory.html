It was she who saw the carnage of the D-Day beaches while he stayed safely on a ship. As a war reporter, she outshone him; as a novelist, he put her in the shade - and the rivalry between them outlived their nine-year relationship, which ended in 1946.</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=1 rowspan=1></td></tr><tr><td colspan=1 rowspan=1><b>Gellhorn with Ernest Hemingway: she rarely spoke about Hemingway because, her stepson says, she 'wanted to rise above the abuse'</b></td></tr></tbody></table><p>It maddened her that, even after Hemingway shot himself in 1961, those dramatic years threatened to eclipse her life's work, and any mention of him in her presence was enough to end a friendship. So, when Carl Rollyson wrote a biography of her 11 years ago, it was a sign of her intense dislike of the book that she remarked: "Hemingway would have adored it."</p><p>One of Rollyson's transgressions was to show some sympathy for the drunken writer who tried to bully the glamorous Gellhorn into being more of a wife and less of a careerist. And now that, three years after her death, Rollyson has written Beautiful Exile, a new biography of Gellhorn, her supporters have taken up the cudgels.</p><p>Five of them have jointly condemned the book for sexual scandal-mongering and cod psychology. They question Rollyson's assumption that the young Gellhorn would have slept with the septuagenarian H G Wells, and describe as "vicious" his conclusion that she was afflicted by self-hatred for doling out sexual favours in return for advancement. They also deny that she lost interest in her adopted son, Sandy.</p><p>Gellhorn's defendants make an intriguing line-up: there's Betsy Drake, the actress who was once married to Cary Grant; investigative journalist John Pilger; writer James Fox; Martha's younger brother, Alfred; and Sandy Matthews, who would appear to be the son to whom, as Rollyson claims, Martha gave "the boot".</p><p>If so, then the Sandy Matthews who greets me at his hilltop house in Devon remains curiously fond of the mother who rejected him. Photographs of "Martha", as he calls her, take pride of place, and almost everything my glance falls upon - a picture, a wooden tortoise, a pine table - was once hers, he tells me, wistfully.</p><p>Showing me around a house that would have met Gellhorn's fastidious standards of housekeeping, he hands me a list of errors in Rollyson's book. "I was not born in an orphanage in Italy," it begins. "I was not schooled in Mexico; I did not go to Columbia; nor was I invalided out of the US army."</p><p>It seems extraordinary that any biographer could get so much wrong. But Gellhorn would not co-operate with Rollyson, and nor would her close friends. She even burnt a pile of papers, including letters from Hemingway, shortly before she died.</p><p>"She felt the relationship was between him and her, and she wanted to be remembered as someone who helped the world. There is an anomaly there," Sandy admits, "but, as an observer, she did not like being the observed. She felt it was uninteresting to talk about your private life, almost bad manners, considering there were more important things to talk about."</p><p>But surely she did adopt a Roman orphan, shortly after her childless marriage to Hemingway ended? "You've got the wrong Sandy," says this one. Rollyson muddled him up with Sandy Gellhorn, "the blond fatty" whom Gellhorn adopted at a time when she didn't want to feel like a "dried seed pod". Sandy Matthews, however, is the youngest child of Tom Matthews, the man Gellhorn married after that experiment with maternity.</p><p>"She was very important in my life. And," he continues, "I would like to think I was important in hers." So it pains him to be conflated and overlooked in this way.</p><p>Although Gellhorn later dismissed her relationship with his father, the former editor of Time magazine, as "a waste of nine invaluable years", she and Sandy developed a powerful bond. They corresponded intensely for 20 years - long, angst-laden letters, he says, in which she discussed human rights and the discomforts of her later years in Kenya and Wales. Those letters, he feels, show the injustice of dismissing her, as Rollyson does, as a woman who loved humanity but hated people. "You can hear her tone in her letters and I don't think you can do that unless you are writing with love, with understanding of other people."</p><p>At times, she was, famously, imperious and demanding. "She did have the habit of intruding," Sandy concedes, "and sometimes, I felt a bit presumed upon. She used to tell me to buck up, and I would be cross because I felt I was pretty bucked up already. But I think it was only because she loved me and was trying to do the best for me."</p><p>She was critical, too, of his interest in dramatic poetry and philosophy. "She always used to say, 'If you are going to write about something, you have to experience it.' I never quite agreed. I was always more abstract. But she said, 'You have to know the number of chairs in the room, even if you don't write it down.' "</p><p>Such precepts lay at the core of Hemingway's style, which she admired long before she met him. Although she usually refused to discuss their relationship with anyone - because, Sandy feels, she "wanted to rise above the abuse, and the only way to do that was ignore it" - she often confided in Matthews. "She talked about him without prompting. She often spoke of this little game they would play of standing in front of a store window and staring for two minutes. Then they would walk away and detail everything and its position. Hemingway always won, however drunk.</p><p>"I don't think he was her great love, but she admired him as a writer. I'm sure competition came into it, when they were both writing novels and reporting, but they were such different people that her books would inevitably be different."</p><p>Does he think, as Rollyson asserts, that she suffered from self-hatred? "No one can see into another's soul, but I think she was proud of what she did, and her great regret was not making a bigger splash in the literary world, which was her first love."</p><p>Reluctantly, he can see why she didn't. "Her books are very period - she felt it was a good thing to steep yourself in the aura of the time; a lot of Hemingway's work will probably date, too. Scott Fitzgerald rather ignores the times: his works were all about very personal relationships. Martha's are, too, but she's trying very hard to place them in the time."</p><p>Matthews doesn't deny Rollyson's suggestion that Gellhorn had an affair with H G Wells, only that it was "unlikely to have been serious". She never discussed with him the operation she apparently had to make intercourse less painful, although he got the impression that she didn't enjoy sex - "but, of course, I only knew her in the second half of her life".</p><p>Martha Gellhorn was 45 when, in 1954, she married Tom Matthews, a widower. Sandy, then 12, was at school in America while his father, a remote man devoted to his work, set up Time magazine in Europe. "I heard the wedding announced over the radio," he remembers. "Afterwards, my father thought it was his duty to bring the family to Britain and I was sent to boarding school. Martha was no more child-oriented than my father, but he wanted her to be a mother to us and she was very conscientious. She had all my teeth done; she made sure I had shoes; she dealt with what she called the kitchen of life."</p><p>Their relationship might have remained dutiful had Sandy, a withdrawn boy, not started writing to Martha, following a lecture from a geneticist. "The A-bomb had gone off; we were under nuclear threat; genetics was challenging human experience in ethical ways. Scientists knew things that the rest of us didn't and Hollywood was candy-flossing it over with movies about life with swimming pools. I wrote all this to Martha and, instead of saying, 'Pay attention to your studies', as another mother would, she wrote back saying this is very concerning.</p><p>"Until then, I had been brought up to believe that you had to do your own thing and the world would take care of itself. Martha was brought up with the opposite philosophy that, as privileged people, we ought to help others."</p><p>In the holidays, Big Sandy, as he was called, played with Little Sandy, Martha's adopted son, six years his junior. "We would go to Hyde Park and get covered in mud and come back to this pristine household. Diana Cooper [Martha's friend] would be waiting on the second floor like a pale ghost and point her finger at us accusingly."</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=1 rowspan=1></td></tr><tr><td colspan=1 rowspan=1><b>Martha, my dear: Gellhorn in 1990</b></td></tr></tbody></table><p>But the two Sandys were very different characters, and Little Sandy was not like Martha at all. Matthews describes the gulf between them with reference to Andre Maurois's classic children's book about Fattypuffs and Thinifers. "Fattypuffs are those people who are laid back and live in the moment; Thinifers rush around worrying about the future - they are rather ant-like and thin. Martha was a Thinifer and Sandy was a Fattypuff. They loved each other but had great difficulty understanding one another. Martha expected a lot from Sandy which he couldn't deliver. He liked to just be; to sit around.</p><p>"I'm sure she tired of him emotionally - she had other things to do with her life - but she never cast him out. If anything, he seemed to reject himself and went into a kind of limbo."</p><p>Big Sandy, however, was a Thinifer like his stepmother, and her divorce from his father merely drew them closer - Martha went to live in Africa; Sandy took three degrees in philosophy and followed her to Africa to teach. They both returned to Britain, where he has been writing plays for Kenneth Branagh's theatre company.</p><p>The Sandys still keep in touch. Recently, a box of oranges arrived from Sandy Gellhorn in New York. And Sandy Matthews, to whom Martha left her estate (plus copious instructions on distribution), has given the other Sandy his due. Three years ago, they stood together on the deck of a tourist boat, discreetly scattering Martha's ashes on the Thames, so she could "continue travelling".</p><p>Since then, Sandy has set up a journalism prize in her name and conducted negotiations with producers who want to make films of her life - but "they fall away like autumn leaves when I mention money".</p><p>He would love to see her books reprinted, fulfilling her wish to be remembered for her work and not for her relationship with Hemingway. He would earn himself some royalties at the same time. But publishers won't reissue the books without a biography. And so, however much Martha might hate it, there will shortly be an official biography, by Caroline Moorhead. And this one will feature not one, but two distinct Sandys.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaJulocG2vsRoa3BqY2qBcnuzoZxmr5Gneqe70WaEmqqkna60ecyepKiqqWO1tbnL</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
