The latest group of gentlemen to have their&nbsp;words&nbsp;used against them are now comedians Chris Rock, Ricky Gervais, & Louis C.K. who all appeared in a 2011 special alongside Jerry Seinfeld.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In a new clip that has since found its way onto the Internet, the former three men have been brought under fire for their lax use of the word "ni--er." The clip in question&nbsp;begins with C.K. stating that&nbsp;"when white people are rich, they're just rich, forever and ever. Even their kids are rich." He adds, "But when a black guy gets rich, it's a countdown to when he's poor again."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Chris Rock goes on to assert that Louis C.K. is the "blackest white guy" he knows before&nbsp;C.K. cuts him off to add, "You're saying I'm a ni--er."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Chris Rock goes onto reply, "Yes, you are the ni--erest fucking white man."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Chris Rock and Louis C.K.'s friendship and professional relationship date back to the [90s when C.K. was a writer on The Chris Rock Show, which offers a semblance of an explanation for such an exchange that has stirred up controversy among others.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Notably, it's Jerry Seinfeld, most known for his clean observational comedy, who looks to be the most uncomfortable out of the bunch.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I don't think he could do that," Seinfeld says. "I don't think he has those qualities."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The rest of the group tries to explain to Seinfeld that this is the difference between Rock and C.K. and Seinfeld and Gervais.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"We say 'ni--er' on stage," Louis says. "You guys don't."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">To that remark, Gervais adds, "We can pair up in different ways but that's definitely a pairing. Who says 'ni--er' on stage? We don't."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"But, you just did," Seinfeld replies.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Naturally, the video has stirred up the classic debate of the use of the N-word across race and culture, with many users placing blame on Chris Rock for allowing C.K. to use the word freely while praising Seinfeld for saying something contrary to the general sentiment in the room. Others have brought into&nbsp;question perceived hypocrisy among critics to call out C.K. for using the word while having no issue when Black comedians use it onstage.&nbsp;</p><p><br><h2>Chris Rock</h2></p><p>Chris Rock, Louis C.K. & Ricky Gervais Facing Backlash For Resurfaced HBO Special</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhbIF0fpBmmqGqmah6s7vCpGSlp6WewG6vymaYp5xdp7akt9hmnp6qppa2tHnFmpqippdir6KvyqWYrKBdm7yzedGeqq6qlpawprCMoZmoZaOlsqS1wKVkp52nqA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
