It's not a criticism, per say. Most successful pop stars hit upon a formula that works, and continue to make variations on said formula until it gets stale. Fortunately, for the Bronx rapper, it hasn't gotten stale. Ice Spice has cornered the market when it comes to trash-talking over pop rap beats with trap flourishes. If "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Munch</a>" is the blueprint for this sound, than "Phat Butt" is evidence that Spice's upcoming album, Y2K, is going to be dedicated exclusively to bangers.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Phat Butt" is actually the first track on Ice Spice's impending debut. Musically speaking, it's easy to see why. There's an bass-heavy start, before the drums kick in and an ominous synth takes over. It's one of the more adventurous beats Spice has rapped on, as it sounds closer to somebody <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Playboi Carti</a> or Ken Carson would release. It also has the self-awareness to not overstay its welcome. "Phat Butt" is a little over two minutes in length, which is perfect. As one can intuit from the title, there isn't much being said that we haven't heard before. Ice Spice trash talks her ops and her butt. There is some fun wordplay on the back end of the song, though, when Spice starts rapping about Batman and Pac-Man. It's light and enjoyable, ultimately.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of this brand-new track, in the comments section down below.
