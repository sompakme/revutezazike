The city that never sleeps... unless it's a Saturday, and then it's too busy weeping. We all know the feeling. You've meticulously planned your epic weekend adventure: brunching outdoors, strolling through the park, maybe even catching a glimpse of a rogue bagel flying down Broadway on a particularly windy day (hey, it's NYC, anything is possible). But then, BAM! Rain. Not a cute, whimsical drizzle, mind you, but a full-on, sidewalk-drowning downpour that makes you question every life decision that led you to stand outside in this weather.</p><p data-sourcepos=5:1-5:244>So, the question begs to be asked: <strong>just how many Saturdays has it rained in this city lately?</strong> Buckle up, folks, because this one might surprise you (or maybe not, if you've been keeping track with rain-soaked misery as your primary metric).</p><h3 data-sourcepos=7:1-7:45>They Did the Math (So You Don't Have To)</h3><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:333>There have been whispers, rumors even, of a <strong>"Great Washout of 2023"</strong>. Let's face it, eight straight weekends of rain can leave a mark on a person's soul (and their outdoor gear). But 2023 is so last year, right? Well, not exactly. While the "Great Washout" may be a memory, the rainy trend seems to be holding strong in 2024.</p><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:355>Here's where things get interesting. According to a highly reliable source (NBC New York, because hey, local news knows what's up), <strong>nearly half</strong> of the rain experienced in the past 12 weeks has fallen on... you guessed it, <strong>Saturdays</strong>. We're talking <strong>almost 6 inches</strong> of rain, folks. That's enough to fill a kiddie pool... several kiddie pools.</p><h3 data-sourcepos=13:1-13:52>Is There a Conspiracy Against Weekend Warriors?</h3><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:368>Look, we're not pointing fingers (okay, maybe a little bit at the sky), but this statistical anomaly has us wondering: <strong>is there a meteorologic mafia</strong> out there with a vendetta against our precious weekends? Is there some disgruntled weatherman with a rain gauge shaped like a tiny umbrella, cackling maniacally every time they see a Saturday forecast turn gloomy?</p><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:223>Maybe. Maybe not. But one thing's for sure: New Yorkers are a resilient bunch. We'll find ways to have fun, even if it means wearing ponchos over our finest brunch attire or braving puddles that could rival the East River.</p><p data-sourcepos=19:1-19:159>Here's a toast (with a slightly rain-diluted beverage, perhaps) to the weekend warriors of NYC. May the odds (and the weather forecast) ever be in your favor.</p>4629179846063693673<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWrGWtnZOdfHN8kW1maWxfnby4ecyapbJlo5bBtr7DmrCsZZiWwG6102apmqGemrFutc1mpbKbXp3Brrg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
