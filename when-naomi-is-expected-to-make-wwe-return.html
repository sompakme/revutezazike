That being said, the company has a lot more in the pipeline, including Naomi’s return to the company as well.</p><p><a href=#>According to the Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a>, Naomi is anticipated to return to WWE. Her TNA Wrestling contract is nearing its end, and there has been a longstanding belief within the company that she would be making her way back to WWE.</p><p><a href=#>PW Insider</a> provided an additional note, as they reported that Naomi is expected to be back in WWE by the end of January. That could see The Glow return to WWE television sooner than later.</p><p>WWE sources have confirmed Trinity is expected to return to the company when she is done with TNA/Impact Wrestling commitments. One source believed she could be back as soon as the end of January. Fightful.com first reported there was an expectation of her return to WWE. I believe she is booked for TNA’s Hard to Kill PPV and at least two TV tapings this month.</p><p>WWE’s Royal Rumble event is going down on January 27th at Tropicana Field. The event is always known to include big returns. It wouldn’t be a huge surprise to see Naomi make her return to the company.</p><p>As we previously reported that Mercedes Mone, on the other hand, is not expected to make a return. The former Sasha Banks is now expected to make her debut with AEW eventually.</p><p>What’s your take on WWE’s plan for Naomi’s return? Do you think she will be back at the Royal Rumble?
