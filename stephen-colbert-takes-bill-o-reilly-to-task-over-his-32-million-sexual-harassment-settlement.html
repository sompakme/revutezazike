So, I guess both her-assing and his-assing.” O’Reilly claimed he was forwarding her harassing messages others sent to him.</p><p>“So, let me get this straight,” he added. “People sent Bill gay pornography when they wrote in to criticize him? It makes perfect sense. ‘Dear Mr. O’Reilly, I could not disagree more on your take about the Republicans’ new tax proposal. And to drive home my point, here are two young men driving home the point.’”</p><p>After the settlement, Fox rewarded O’Reilly with a $25 million per year contract. “What did Bill O’Reilly do to Bill O’Reilly?” Colbert asked. “It’s shocking that Fox News knew about all these sexual-harassment settlements and kept him employed for so long. But maybe they were just trying to protect their female employees. Because if Bill’s on camera, that’s one hour a day they knew he’s not groping somebody.”</p><p>Summing up Fox’s apparent policy toward O’Reilly over the years, Colbert said, “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, some more shame. Fool me three times, you really gotta do a better job of fooling me. Four times, we're extending your contract. Five times, we wish the best of luck to Bill in all his future endeavors—now, enjoy the Tucker Carlson show!” &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVfqMGmvMeepWabn6Gvpr7TZquao5WoeqO1y6VkqKqVnrmtxYytpmaskai4brvVnqlmoJmoeqW7y6WYq2tiYrqquMuipqdlo5rFtq3LZp%2BaqpGowK6xza1krJ2kqbmmucSnqw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
