In a recent interview with <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>, producer Charles Roven told them that he and his crew are definitely planning to make another film in the action adventure franchise.</p><p><strong>Oh yeah! We had a really good time with that movie. The fans really liked the movie, and people who didn’t know anything about the game really liked the movie. So we are definitely looking to make another one of those.</strong></p>Charles Roven on making another <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Uncharted data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Uncharted</a> film<p>The legendary producer is known for working with Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas on The Dark Knight trilogy and most recently on <a href=#>Oppenheimer.</a> When asked about continuing the Uncharted franchise, he responded with excitement, sharing that the crew had a really good time with the first movie.</p><p>In Uncharted, <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="Tom Holland" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Tom Holland</a> plays Nathan Drake, a street-smart young pickpocket who gets recruited by Mark Wahlberg’s character (Victor “Sully” Sullivan) to help find Ferdinand Magellan’s lost treasure. The two must work together, battling against adversaries all along the way. Antonio Banderas&nbsp;plays Santiago Moncada, the villain who is also looking for the long-lost treasure, and Sophia Ali portrayed Chloe Frazer, as Sully’s associate.</p><p>While no plot points or cast members have been revealed for Uncharted 2 just yet, we hope to see the entertaining duo of Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg make their return to the franchise. The two action stars have a natural chemistry with one another that is made even better thanks to their mutual sense of humor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/uncharted-tom-holland-mark-wahlberg-900x507.jpg><p>After the first film grossed $401.7&nbsp;million worldwide, it’s no wonder why the franchise wouldn’t continue with a few more movies. But while many fans enjoyed the action and adventure of Uncharted, some critics tore it apart. Some felt that the film had an underwhelming storyline that made it feel like a knock-off version of Raiders of the Lost Ark, and others felt that the characters did not have enough depth and development.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-uncharted-2-could-be-about><strong>What Uncharted 2 Could Be About</strong></h3><p>Uncharted’s ending set up possibilities for a potential storyline for the sequel film. Nathan could set out to find his brother Sam, whom he now knows is alive. Likewise, a post-credit scene from the first film revealed Gage (Pilou Asbæk) the associate of a major game antagonist named Gabriel Roman. Uncharted 2 could follow the plot of the original Naughty Dog game, which saw Roman as the main villain.</p><p>In addition to producer Charles Roven wanting to create a sequel to the first Uncharted, the chairman of Sony Pictures, Tom Rothman, has openly said that he wants it to be a new franchise. The director of the first film, Ruben Fleischer, would also like to create a sequel and has said that he would like to create the car chase sequence from A Thief’s End, the fourth Uncharted video game.</p><p>Hopefully, more details will emerge on Uncharted 2 once the WGA/SAG strike is over. Perhaps then Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg will share whether or not they are on board for the action-adventure franchise.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2isn6J6qbvLpZinnF2qu6S0wKurnpxdZ3upwMyl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
