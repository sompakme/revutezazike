It is used in the treatment of nausea and vomiting. Promethazine topical gel is a convenient method to provide this nausea medication to your kid.</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Then there’s the subject of how to apply Phenergan gel.</h3><p><span>Promethazine transdermal gel may be applied to the wrist every 4-6 hours as required to relieve nausea and vomiting caused by motion sickness or pregnancy (or as directed by the prescriber). Washing your hands before and after applying medicine is very essential. This is particularly true when you are delivering medication to another person, such as a little kid.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>As a result, the question is: how much phenergan gel am I allowed to consume?</h3><p><span>It is recommended that children and adults take 25 mg of Phenergan on an average daily basis for the active treatment of nausea and vomiting. When oral medicine cannot be tolerated, the dosage should be administered parenterally (see also ).</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>As a result, does Phenergan gel cause you to feel sleepy?</h3><p><span>extreme sleepiness, weak or shallow breathing; feeling light-headed, as if you are about to fall out; disorientation and agitation; hallucinations; nightmares; seizure (convulsions); sedation</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>How long does it take for the effects of Phenergan to take effect?</h3><p><span>Promethazine will begin to make you feel drowsy around 20 minutes after you take it and may continue to work for up to 12 hours after that. If you’re taking it for a cough or cold, allergies, or nausea, your symptoms should begin to improve within 20 minutes of taking the medication. The medication should be effective for around 4 to 6 hours.</span></p><h3></h3><h3>There were 12 related questions and answers found.</h3><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>What is a Phenergan side effect that you should know about?</h3><p><span>DROWSYNESS, DIzziness, constipation, blurred vision, and dry mouth are all possible side effects of this medication. Inform your doctor if any of these side effects continue or worsen over time.</span></p><h3></h3><h3>Can I use Phenergan on a daily basis?</h3><p><span>If your doctor has prescribed this medicine, take it by mouth with or without food as advised by your doctor, generally 2 to 4 times a day. If you are experiencing motion sickness, take your first dosage of promethazine 30 to 60 minutes before you begin your trip journey. This drug, which is used to treat allergies, should be given once daily at night to prevent becoming sleepy throughout the day.</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Is it possible to die from taking too much Phenergan?</h3><p><span>Heart rhythm abnormalities and seizures are associated with the greatest risk of a severe result in those who suffer from them. In reality, only a small number of individuals die from promethazine overdose.</span></p><h3></h3><h3>How frequently should I use the Phenergan gel?</h3><p><span>When used for the active treatment of nausea and vomiting in either children or adults, the average effective dosage of promethazine HCl is 25 mg. Doses ranging from 12.5 to 25 mg may be repeated as often as required at 4- to 6-hour intervals.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is Phenergan a good anti-anxiety medication?</h3><p><span>Currently, only generic versions of promethazine oral tablet are available. This medication is used to treat a variety of ailments, including allergies, motion sickness, nausea and vomiting as well as anxiety before surgery and pain after surgery. It is also used as a sleep aid, particularly before and after surgical procedures.</span></p><h3></h3><h3>Is it possible to get high on promethazine alone?</h3><p><span>Product formulations containing promethazine are misused for their sedative effects and ability to induce delirium in the user. When used with opioids, promethazine increases the euphoric effects of the opioid while allowing for a lesser dosage of the opioid to be used. Ninety-five percent of the cases included promethazine alone (PA), whereas 259 had promethazine compounded with other medications (PC).</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>What is the best place to put Phenergan gel?</h3><p><span>Application of the gel should be done on your child’s wrist. Even though the gel is intended for use in the treatment of nausea and vomiting, it should not be applied to the belly. Examine the skin’s condition. Only apply the gel to a normal-looking region of skin.</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3></h3><h3>Is Phenergan hazardous for your kidneys?</h3><p><span>In contrast to younger adults, elderly patients may be more sensitive to the side effects of this medication (such as confusion and severe drowsiness) than younger adults, and are more likely to have age-related heart or blood vessel disease, liver problems, and kidney disease, which may necessitate an adjustment of the medication’s dosage in patients receiving this medication.</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfY6wn5qsXZ7AbrzHnqWeqpeWu26zxKVloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
