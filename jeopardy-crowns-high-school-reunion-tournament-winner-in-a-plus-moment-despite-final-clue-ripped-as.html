KIDS EDITION?'</h2><p>On Reddit, fans knocked the tournament's final clue for being a little obvious.</p><p>One fan wrote: "Was that one of the easiest FJs ever? That might be the most literal description of a landmark that's already one of the most iconic and thought of landmarks in the world."</p><p>Another wrote: "It’s absurd, honestly. The difficulty was all over the place this tournament, but that could’ve been the final of a Jeopardy Kids edition."</p><p>A third wondered: "Was that really the Final Jeopardy question? May as well have told them it's in France while you're at it."</p><h2>DARK HORSE!</h2><p>But the rest celebrated Justin's unexpected win (given he was behind Jackson going in) as one wrote: "I’m so happy for Justin! He’s just the cutest!!"</p><p>"Pays to wear a suit, boys," wrote another.</p><p>One of the semi-finalists <a href=#>Caleb Richmond</a> wrote he was in the audience and that "Justin has a resounding fan club."</p><p>Justin is studying economics and international and public affairs at Brown.</p><p>In his quarter-finals game, Justin showed he was not messing around with a huge&nbsp;<a href=#>$8,800 Daily Double bet</a>, and advancing from there.</p><p>Waiting in the wings to now face him are some serious quizzers like <a href=#>Cris Pannullo (21 wins)</a> and <a href=#>Troy Meyer (6 wins).</a></p><p>“It’s going to be crazy,” Justin said in a statement. “I think everybody knows that people who go on mega-streaks are really, really good, so I can only hope to do my best against them. We’ll see what they have in store for me.”</p><p>It's worth noting right now the <a href=#>2023 Tournament of Champions has a lineup of only men</a>, but he earned his way there and who doesn't love a dark horse?</p><h2>GLITCH FOR THE BOOKS</h2><p>There was a newsmaking blunder last episode and in the first half of the finals which smudged <a href=#>Jeopardy!'s</a> record a bit.</p><p>The contestants' final scores on their podiums flashed on-screen for multiple seconds before the game had begun.</p><p><a href=#>The U.S. Sun was the first to report the antenna-adjusting incident</a>&nbsp;on March 8's episode when it aired.</p><p>Mayim was congratulating the finalists and wished them good luck when the camera cut to their final tallies showing.</p><p><a href=#>Jackson's</a>&nbsp;$24,000,&nbsp;Justin's&nbsp;$13,570, and&nbsp;Maya's&nbsp;$3,370 (combined with their scores tonight) remained on screen for several seconds and were indeed their totals in the end.</p><p><a href=#>Jeopardy!</a>&nbsp;could not spoil the ultimate result of the college students’ fierce faceoff, because it’s a two-game match, but it certainly caused a ruckus.</p><p>Clamoring fans took to Twitter calling the slip-up everything from a "big oopsie" to a "horrendous" look for the&nbsp;<a href=#>game show</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p><a href=#>Ken Jennings</a>, 47 is returning tomorrow, March 10 to&nbsp;<a href=#>host regular episodes</a> with reigning champ Stephen Webb trying to go for win 4 which would also qualify him for the 2023 Tournament of Champions.</p><p><a href=#>The G.O.A.T contestant</a> will be hosting regular episodes until May 1, welcome news for those who have been mixed on <a href=#>Mayim's hosting chops and her noticeable pauses.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/taken-without-permission-class-dismissed-801694757.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/taken-without-permission-class-dismissed-801694666.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/taken-without-permission-class-dismissed-801694667.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZW5%2BdYCVaKGep6CWv6XFjKOsrKyZo3qju8usnKdlmJ60qXnSnJ%2Bop5xiv6bBzaKmp2WkpMKzusCmnKesXay2r7rEq2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
