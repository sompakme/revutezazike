Cohen, a Republican, held positions in both the House of Representatives and the Senate before being appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton to the position of Secretary of Defense.</p><p>The attorney has enjoyed a very prosperous and accomplished career. In a similar vein, William’s wife Janet enjoys the same level of success as he does.</p><h2 id=meet-william-cohen-wife-janet-langhart-cohen>Meet William Cohen Wife Janet Langhart Cohen</h2><p>Janet is a well-known writer and journalist for television who hails from the United States. In the beginning of her career, Langhart was a model in Chicago. She did work for Marshall Field’s as well as the Ebony Fashion Fair. She was awarded the title of Miss Chicagoland in 1967.</p><p>After serving as the “weather gal” for channel 26, WCIU, Langhart moved on to become the first black “weathergirl” on WBBM-first TV in the year 1970, when she was already 29 years old. [16] She started anchoring “Indy Today,” an early morning interview programme for women on WISH-TV in Indianapolis at the same time. “Indy Today” aired on WISH-TV. In order to work on both shows, she was required to travel back and forth between Indianapolis and Chicago.</p><p>In a similar vein, she became well known for her work as a black television journalist at a number of different stations. She had her first television appearance in September 1973 on WCVB-TV in Boston, where she was a co-host of the morning show Good Day! (which was initially titled Good Morning!).</p><p>Later, in the middle of 1978, she was offered a job as the host of the daily conversation and interview show People to People by NBC and moved to New York City as a result of this opportunity. However, the new show was swiftly renamed America Alive, and instead of anchoring her own show, Langhart joined the show as a roving journalist and co-host alongside Bruce Jenner and Pat Mitchell.</p><p>She presently holds the position of president and chief executive officer at Langhart Communication. In addition to that, she is the spouse of former Secretary of Defense William Cohen.</p><h2 id=age-gap-between-william-cohen-and-janet-langhart-cohen>Age Gap Between William Cohen And Janet Langhart Cohen</h2><p>William and Janet are only separated by a year in age from one another.</p><p>When Langhart was stationed in Boston and Cohen was a member of the Maine congressional delegation, they first spoke over the phone during a long-distance interview. This was back when Langhart was based in Boston.</p><p>Before she started working for BET in Washington, D.C., the couple had never actually spoken to one another in person. During that time, one of the politicians named Andrew Young set up a meeting between her and William. Since then, they’ve developed a friendship with one another. After getting divorced from their prior partner, the two individuals started dating one other.</p><p>In addition, before to being married, the pair dated exclusively for a number of years. After some time had passed, on the holiday of Valentine’s Day in 1996, the couple got married in the United States Capitol. However, the pair has not been successful in conceiving a child through their marriage; instead, they have chosen to take in a dog.</p><p>Comparative Analysis of William Cohen and Janet Langhart Cohen’s Net Wort</p><h2 id=net-worth-comparison-william-cohen-and-janet-langhart-cohen>Net Worth Comparison William Cohen And Janet Langhart Cohen</h2><p>As of the 22nd of November in 2021, it is predicted that William G Cohen’s net worth is at least 1.11 million dollars.
