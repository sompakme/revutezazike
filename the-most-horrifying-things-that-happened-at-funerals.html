Although tragic on its own, her family's nightmare had only just begun. They held a memorial on August 15 and Mott was to be cremated the following day. According to the funeral home, when they returned the next morning, Mott's body was gone. The coffin had a broken hinge, but the building itself had no signs of forced entry, the security system wasn't triggered, and the cameras didn't catch anything suspicious, <a href=#>according to the San Antonio Express-News</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Police investigated, but found no suspects, much less the body. They had one person of interest: Julie Mott's ex-boyfriend, Bill Wilburn, whom Mott had left two years earlier, was reportedly obsessed with her. Funeral home employees said they had to escort Wilburn out of the building when he lingered after Mott's memorial. Police later discovered Wilburn had called the funeral home hundreds of times before the <a href=#>funeral</a>, and was reportedly vocally unhappy with the decision to have her cremated, <a href=#>according to the Laredo Morning Times</a>.</p><p>Despite this, though, investigators found no evidence implicating Wilburn, and he was never formally accused of the <a href=#>crime</a>. Corpse-sniffing dogs even inspected Wilburn's car and property, but found nothing, <a href=#>according to KENS 5</a>. Mott's family sued the funeral home, which had used a contractor they gave "unfettered" access to the building, for gross negligence, but the culprit and body have still never been found.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9lm1pb2hfqbWmecyoqq1lmKS%2Fs7XFsqCnn12ptaq6xqxkraCRqXqprc%2BpnKedlGKutXnFrqWeqpGhwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
