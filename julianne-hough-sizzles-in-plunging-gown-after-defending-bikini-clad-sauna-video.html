I get it," she said.&nbsp;</p><p id=eEBUqjfuKs data-wc=18>"I'm a 35-year-old woman who is proud of my body, and I'm okay to post that," Julianne added.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cd2f93925421-julianne-hough-brown-bikini.jpg><p id=e2tS-5zfyT data-wc=15>Julianne certainly looks after her body and the results of her consistent work are evident.&nbsp;</p><p id=eG_LVCbqPx data-wc=34>Not only is her incredibly toned physique the result of her being a professional dancer with her own fitness brand, KINRGY, but she also follows a healthy diet, which includes drinking plenty of water.&nbsp;</p><p id=e0e2XziURF5 data-wc=61>"I have this water bottle that goes everywhere with me. Every night, before bed, I put ice in it and fill it to the top — it holds 40 ounces of water — and I drink it throughout the night. Not all of it, obviously, but I have to have cold water before I go to bed," Julianne told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Delish magazine</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e31527e29b45-julianne-hough-bikini.jpg><p id=e_-5LumzRPy data-wc=14>Another method Julianne swears by to help maintain her health is frequent ice baths.</p><p id=eWiwn6Se5ZD data-wc=32>"I've been doing ice baths since 2015 when I was touring the country on stage for 2.5 hrs almost every night," she wrote alongside a video of her in one in June.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a02cc3d05555-julianne-hough-red-long-dress.jpg><p id=esVa3SnQNm data-wc=42>"In 2014, I had the worst neck injury the whole tour that I just couldn't fathom the pain and pure survival mode again versus being able to fully enjoy being on stage night after night. So I committed and never looked back!"&nbsp;</p><p id=eMJi3qhcfv data-wc=33>She added: "The amount of recovery I have spent on my body in my later years of life would've been much less if I had known about the benefits of contrast therapy earlier."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
