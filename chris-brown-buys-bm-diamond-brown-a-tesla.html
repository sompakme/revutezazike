Thank u CB.”</p><p>Fans quickly flooded the comment section to share their thoughts. “Chris is amazing - always taking care of his kids & their mothers. Y’all dudes need to take notes,” one fan wrote. “The man embodies growth and learning from your past, love to see it,” another added.&nbsp; Chris’ growth has been acknowledged by fans and peers alike. After his performance at the American Music Awards was cancelled, many celebs championed for Brown’s return to the stage.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# class=text-word rel>Kelly Rowland</a> was one of the most vocal when it came to defending Breezy. “I want to tell Chris, thank you so much for making great R&B music,” she shared while accepting his award. “And I want to tell him, thank you for being an incredible performer. I’ll take this award, bring it to you. I love you. Congratulations!”&nbsp; The singer doubled down on her statements the following day, adding that Brown deserves grace.&nbsp;</p><p>“Before we point fingers at anybody, we should realize how grateful we are for every moment that we get,” she said. “Even our own things that we have. I think it’s just important to remember to be human. We are humans.” See Chris Brown and Ammika’s baby girl below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmZYR6hZFmmqGqmah6o77OsKVmmqWuwG6uzGabopmdpLulecGrprCmXZZ6tbHSpZg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
