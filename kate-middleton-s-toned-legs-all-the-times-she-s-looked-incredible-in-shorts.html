Hiking</strong></h3><p id=e8m2FaqaV2UE data-wc=43>Duchess Kate and Prince William have been pictured enjoying the great outdoors, and hiking with their dogs, on many occasions, and while hiking might not get the heart rate up quite like other activities that Duchess Kate loves, it's key for leg toning.</p><p id=esjWtFXyP7wM data-wc=35>"One of the most important (yet underrated) exercises to get toned legs is walking," confirms David.
