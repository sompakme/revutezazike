Projects like <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Eat Or Get Ate</a> set the stage for his ascent. Meanwhile, 2022’s <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">East Haiti Baby s</a>erved as a testament to his dexterous flow, impeccable beat selection, and raw tales from East Memphis. Unfortunately, months after the release of the 2022 album, Moochie found himself behind bars for a probation violation.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“I got caught with a gun. Possession of a handgun by a convicted felon. And this would lead to the whole thing,” he explained to HotNewHipHop in his first interview since his release on January 17th, 2024. “But me not going to see probation… Like I said, with Dolph passing, it just took a&nbsp; big toll on me, and I just wasn’t in my right state of mind.” However, even from behind bars, the "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Freestyle</a>" rapper didn’t let his time go to waste. In November 2023, he unveiled East Haiti Baby: Incarcerated, the deluxe edition to his 2022 opus, which boasted appearances from other incarcerated rappers, including YFN Lucci, Rio Da Yung OG, and C-Murder, who shares words of wisdom during the interlude.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Coming home after his stint behind bars, he hit the ground running. He filmed his From The Block performance of his new single, "WAKE EM UP" immediately after his release, which debuted on Tuesday night, and hit the studio to work on his next project, which HotNewHipHop can confirm exclusively will be titled Eat Or Get Ate 2.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">We caught up with Big Moochie Grape shortly after his release to discuss the next chapter of his career, how his friendship with Jay Fizzle led to his deal with Young Dolph, and why PRE is the best movement.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>HotNewHipHop:</strong> <strong>How does it feel to be home? Especially with the success you achieved during your time behind bars</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Big Moochie Grape:</strong> It feels great. I’m just ready to get back to it. I’m ready to stay working.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>What was the first thing when you got back home?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>You shot a music video, too, right?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Yeah, I shot the music video at the jail. Left the jail and went straight to the studio.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>What was your first meal once you came back home? I’m sure the food behind bars wasn’t the greatest.</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Yeah, you know, we eat steak and stay up late.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>If you don’t mind, could you walk me through what led to your incarceration?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">I got caught with a gun. Possession of a handgun by a convicted felon.

Did you feel like people treated you differently when you went to jail considering your status?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Yeah, people treated me different, the inmates, you know what I’m saying? Some of the inmates never been locked up with somebody like me. I had people working for me in jail, like I was kicked up, boss status. You know, I was in a little country town so, you know, they ain’t used to somebody like me. Like, they was infatuated.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>You caught the case in Georgia. Currently, you have any conditions?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Yeah, I got a few conditions for like six months. After that, I’m back on the road.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>In your absence, it felt like Memphis reclaimed its position as a major hub in hip-hop. How do you feel about the way your city has a firm grip on the genre right now?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It’s a good feeling knowing that it comes from my hometown but to keep it 100, I’m not really worried about no other Memphis rapper. Just me and my team.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>How do you feel about the way PRE kept their foot on the gas while you were locked up?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Yeah. The best movement ever.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>How would you describe the way PRE distinguishes itself compared to the other labels, collectives and groups within hip-hop?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">We’re phenomenal.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Could you elaborate a little further on that?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Like, ain’t nobody seeing us in any shape, form or fashion. We do it our way and nobody else way.</p><p>Via @IThinkEthan</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>I’m sure that’s something that Young Dolph instilled into you early on, especially moving as an independent artist. On “Non Stop,” you rap, “</strong><strong>Major labels callin' my phone, know I'm finna decline it</strong><strong>.” At this point, how do you think a major label could benefit you?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It wouldn’t benefit me at all. I don’t plan on doing it.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Can you tell me about how you and Young Dolph first linked up? I read that you were basically debuting music throughout clubs in Memphis, and it eventually landed on Dolph’s radar.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The other artist on the label, Jay Fizzle -- that’s my best friend, so that’s how really I was around. I was already around, and then I just started making music out of the blue, and [Young Dolph] loved the sh*t.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Did the fact that you made music surprise him at that point?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Yeah. It was surprising because I wasn’t even making music at first.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>C-Murder appears on the project during the interlude, and he tells you to use your time wisely. How did you use your time behind bars?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Just did a whole lot of thinking. Like, trying to figure out myself. I was putting the project together the whole time, trying to feed the streets.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Did you create a vision board or anything like that to determine what you wanted to do and the goals you had once you came home?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Nah, I just called home, go over it with my team, and we came up with a plan.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Have you been able to speak to C-Murder since your release?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">No, not yet, but it’s coming.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Was he someone that you listened to often growing up?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Yeah, I done listened to him when I was younger.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Does any particular C-Murder or No Limit album or song stand out to you?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Actually, I like the whole TRU [by True] album.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Do you remember discovering that album?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Oh no, not really. I just came across it.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Eat Or Get Ate made a strong statement</strong>. <strong>Then, East Haiti Baby further cemented your name. Can you tell me about creating this album?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Yeah, I was in jail for like four and a half months. And then, I got out, and I just started going crazy. That’s how East Haiti Baby came about. But it’s also about me coming from my side, East Memphis. Like, what I’ve been through. I’m basically giving them my life story.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Okay, word. So what was the process behind the deluxe edition? I’m sure you and your team were in close contact to bring this to life, but who was the person who helped flesh out the deluxe?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Shit, CEO, my management team. My folks got something going on. They know what they’re doing, so I just follow the lead. Plus, I called home every day, and we were going over the album. So, I got a chance to listen to the songs over the phone and, you know, make it happen.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>What was your reaction when you actually got to hear the project in its entirety, mixed and mastered on quality speakers?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Oh, it sounded real good.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>What was your favorite track off of the deluxe?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">All of them, even the interlude.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>You’ve also expanded into philanthropy.
