He first met Mariah Carey in 2006 when he worked as a backup dancer on her Adventures of Mimi tour, per <a href=#>People</a>. Recalling the first time they met, Tanaka told <a href=#>E! News</a>, "Our first introduction was kind of a sweaty mess, because I was on stage sweating... she came out all looking gorgeous and everything. But it was great we said 'Hi' real quick and we got back to work."&nbsp;</p><p>But as he added in <a href=#>another interview with E!</a>, they shared an instant connection during that first tour. "Something connected with us back in the day and there was just a mutual admiration," Tanaka said. "It was set in history that we were gonna be connected some way, some how."</p><p>Tanaka has gone on to work with other superstars, including Beyonc√©, Madonna, Rihanna, Usher, and Lady Gaga. He even appeared in the movie La La Land.&nbsp;He's also on the teaching faculty at <a href=#>Broadway Dance Center</a>.</p><p>The 36-year-old dancer always remained close with Carey, 49, over the years. Eventually, their bond became romantic. Carey first shared a <a href=#>photo of her new beau</a> on social media on Valentine's Day 2017. Now that the pair are lovebirds, they still work together professionally, with Tanaka dancing, choreographing, and creative directing for Carey's live shows and <a href=#>music videos</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmanFla356e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5zJqpopmYYrCivsSyqmaan66zs7XEp5to</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
