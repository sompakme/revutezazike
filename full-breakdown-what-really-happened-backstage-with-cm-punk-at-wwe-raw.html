However, new details have emerged that suggest his visit was not as dramatic as some fans initially thought.</p><p>According to PWInsider, <a href=#>Punk spent his time backstage mingling with WWE talent and speaking with individuals</a> such as The Miz, Bobby Lashley, Baron Corbin, Tamina, and primarily Paul Levesque. He remained in communal area backstage throughout his visit and there were no secret meetings or attempts to gauge interest in a WWE return, <a href=#>nor was it a publicity stunt ahead of his impending return to AEW, despite people thinking it was</a>.</p><p>Punk reportedly wanted to speak to Levesque privately and asked if he could stay backstage for a couple of minutes, but Levesque informed him that he would have to ask Vince McMahon. <a href=#>McMahon, who was working remotely</a> and not present at the event, decided that Punk was <a href=#>not allowed to stay and security escorted him out of the building</a>.</p><p>It appears that Punk’s visit was merely a case of him wanting to make up with individuals he had issues with in the past, and he was respectful throughout the whole time he was there. There were no issues, and he left when he was asked to.</p><p>Ringside News reached out to a tenured member of the WWE creative team, <a href=#>who stated that “no one cared about Punk being there.</a>” The source noted that WWE had a sold-out crowd in Chicago, creative changes, a pay-per-view in 12 days, and sold-out live events happening all at the same time. To WWE stars, CM Punk is not a significant name.</p><p>Despite this, <a href=#>Punk received warm reception from those he spoke to backstage</a>. However, his visit did not have a significant impact due to the busy schedule of the event. It is expected that he will make an appearance soon on AEW television, with the company’s Saturday show set to start up in a matter of weeks.</p><p>It remains to be seen what the future holds for CM Punk in the wrestling industry, but fans will undoubtedly be watching closely to see what he does next.</p><p>What do you think of CM Punk’s recent backstage visit to WWE and what impact do you think it will have on his future in the wrestling industry?
