It turns out that he is not leaving everything WWE puts out so soon.</p><p>Wyatt’s Fiend character was one of the most creative gimmicks in the company’s history. In a creatively restricted environment such as WWE, fans wondered how much creative control Wyatt really had.</p><p><a href=#>WWE 2K22 was announced during WrestleMania 37</a>. After much waiting, WWE revealed during SummerSlam that the game will release&nbsp;<a href=#>next year in March,</a> as opposed to this year.</p><p>As reported earlier, the WWE 2K22 had to delay the release of the game due to WWE releasing so many talents this year. Ultimately, the delay caused the relationship<a href=#>&nbsp;between WWE and 2k to become ‘really strained.’</a></p><p>According to <a href=#>Brian Mazique of Forbes</a>, talks with sources have indicated that the WWE 2K22 roster will be larger than expected. It was said that talents that were released by WWE were still under contract, and on the initially submitted/approved roster, when details were sent to 2K, they could still be put in the game.</p><p>It was added that the likes of Bray Wyatt, Johnny Gargano and Keith Lee are likely to be added in the game. Around 150 stars will make up the game’s roster at this point.</p><p>We will have to wait and see how WWE 2k22 turns out next year. The future of the franchise practically rests on the success of the game. Judging by the latest updates, perhaps there is some hope left.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
