One person wrote on Twitter: "Roadkill on BBC with @hughlaurie has to be one of the most gripping political thrillers I've seen in a long time. Cast is outstanding, music is brilliant and plot is fab. I just need a series 2 just to see Hugh Laurie as prime minister."</p><p id=eQJzG4wqjeaU data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Meet Roadkill star Hugh Laurie's wife Jo Green here</a></strong></p><p id=enPU35WRVVQ2 data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Meet the cast of new BBC political thriller Roadkill</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/78921057aa5c-hugh-roadkill-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=enDWASW9XY9a data-wc=4><strong>Hugh as Peter Laurence</strong></p><p id=ebbZJWshfkzj data-wc=52>Another said: "I enjoyed #Roadkill. It didn't finish how I expected it to and by the end I quite liked Hugh Laurie's character even though I feel like we weren't really supposed to. His new daughter was cast to perfection. <strong>Excellent chemistry between the two as well. Would love a second series."</strong></p><p id=ewVqnfTJlOHe data-wc=32>However, others are less keen on the idea and have been seemingly unimpressed by the four episodes. One person commented on social media: <strong>"Okay, after 1 1/2 episodes, I'm done with #Roadkill.</strong></p><p id=ec8ReCw_XhhA data-wc=40>"What a load of cliched, clunky, ridiculous dross, made all the more offensive by the fact that it has a talented cast and they appear to have spent a bit of money on it.
