Read on - and check back - to find out all the details; who's marrying who, what they'll wear, and who'll be there.&nbsp;<strong>Part five: Jesse and Kat's anniversary celebration – August 2011</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6816c3405952-jesse-james-z.jpg></strong><h2 align=left><strong>The engagement:&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=ebsZievbls data-wc=80>Jesse's romance with Kat came at a turbulent time in his life. In March 2010, he found himself at the centre of a media storm when it emerged he had repeatedly been unfaithful to America's sweetheart <a class=hm-link href=#>Sandra Bullock</a> during their five-year marriage. The following month, Sandra filed for divorce – finalised on June 28 – and Jesse's status as the poster boy for celebrity infidelity was cemented. In August, he found love again with TV tattoo artist Kat Von D.&nbsp;</p><p id=eusKzl7oiFy data-wc=78>After speculation in the press, she confirmed reports that they were indeed dating on Twitter – later deleted – and it wasn’t long before their romance started to play out in public. It has been a whirlwind relationship - in September, they made their debut as a couple, during which Kat declared Jesse to be 'The One'. Numerous public declarations of love followed signalling a growing commitment, and then, in January 2011, the tattooed pair announced their engagement.&nbsp;</p><p id=ej2dmRiX29 data-wc=108>In a statement, Jesse said: "You know sometimes the public and the press get it wrong. This is one of those times. 2010 was actually the best year of my life because I fell in love with my best friend. An amazing woman who stood behind me when the world turned their backs. "Following media reports the couple had called off their marriage plans after venting personal problems on Twitter, Jesse and Kat confirmed the wedding was still on and would be taking place in the summer to mark the one-year anniversary of when they started dating. It will be the fourth time that Jesse ties the knot.&nbsp;</p><h2 align=left><strong>The dress:&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=eh7v7E0834 data-wc=85>Not much is known about the details of Kat and Jesse's big day. But what is certain is that the bride will bring her signature sexy gothic style to proceedings. When it comes to her dress, the 29-year-old is likely to choose something that showcases her tattoos – she has numerous, including portraits of her mum, sister and idol Beethoven. Kat also likes to model the fashions of the pinup queens from the 40s and 50s, which may well be reflected in her gown selection.</p><h2 align=left><strong>The ceremony:&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=ekQvky3jBJ data-wc=88>Jesse, 42, and Kat's wedding ceremony is likely to be a romantic affair if the couple's Twitter messages&nbsp;are anything to go by. It will probably take place in either Los Angeles, where Kat shoots her reality show, or in Austin, Texas, where Jesse lives with his kids, Chandler, 16, Jesse Jr, 14 and seven-year-old Sunny. Likely guests will include the three children, Kat's siblings Karoline and Michael, and some of her co-stars. Jesse's beloved dogs, including pitbull Cinnabun, are also expected to feature.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
