When they welcome back moviegoers, the theater will also have staggered showtimes to reduce crowding in the lobbies. Other safety measures include face coverings, daily health screenings for the employees, increased cleaning and sanitization protocols and hand sanitizer stations for the guests.</p><p>Consolidated Theatres, which operates the theaters at the Queen Ka’ahumanu Center, could not be reached for comment Friday.
